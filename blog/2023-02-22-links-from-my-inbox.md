> Tippy Coco is a free, open-source game by Chris Coyne (chriscoyne.com / @malgorithms). The inspiration for this game was Slime Volleyball, a 1999 Java Applet by Daniel Wedge & Quin Pendragon. I called an earlier version of this game They Came from the Ground.

> Music in Tippy Coco is by my friend Christian Rudder, of the band Bishop Allen. "Rejected!" and "Slam!" and "Kiss" were voiced by Jennie, Cameron, and Abbott Coyne. And the character TippyCoco is named after our friends' dog, TippiCocoa.

2023-02-21 [Snort - Network Intrusion Detection & Prevention System](https://www.snort.org/) 

> I just put it here, it is so cool
>
> Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and generates alerts for users.
>
> Snort can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well. Snort has three primary uses: As a packet sniffer like tcpdump, as a packet logger — which is useful for network traffic debugging, or it can be used as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system. Snort can be downloaded and configured for personal and business use alike.![image-20230224205015067](./2023-02-22-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230224205015067.png)

> C++ is about to turn 40. Though the ecosystem was very diverse and incomplete for many years, it is getting better! In this talk, I will discuss:
> The typical “project model - compiler - debugger” triad, and how it still depends on the area of usage (Embedded or Game Development).
> How the build systems and dependency managers are now more standard.
> How Clang affected the standard toolset in all areas, forming not only a baseline for compilers, but also formatters, code analyzers, and IDEs.
> How many code analyzers exist for C++ and why there is still room for improvement.
> How unit testing and code coverage solutions can be used effectively.
> And finally, how the language committee is learning to listen to and help standard toolset contributors.
