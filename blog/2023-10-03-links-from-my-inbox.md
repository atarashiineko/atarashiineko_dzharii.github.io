2023-08-15 Book 🚩 [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/toc.html)

>We’ve found that expertise and shared communication forums offer great value as an organization scales.  As engineers discuss and answer questions in shared forums, knowledge tends to spread. New experts grow. If you have a hundred engineers writing Java, a single friendly and helpful Java expert willing to answer questions will soon produce a hundred engineers writing better Java code. Knowledge is viral, experts are carriers, and there’s a lot to be said for the value of clearing away the common stumbling blocks for your engineers.

> **daktilo** ("typewriter" in Turkish, pronounced *"duck-til-oh"*, derived from the Ancient Greek word [δάκτυλος](https://lsj.gr/wiki/δάκτυλος) for "finger") is a small command-line program that plays typewriter sounds every time you press a key. It also offers the flexibility to customize keypress sounds to your liking. You can use the built-in sound presets to create an enjoyable typing experience, whether you're crafting emails or up to some prank on your boss.

2023-09-09 [Optimizing Spark jobs for maximum performance](https://michalsenkyr.github.io/2018/01/spark-performance)

>  Let’s take a look at these two definitions of the same computation:

```scala
val input = sc.parallelize(1 to 10000000, 42).map(x => (x % 42, x))
val definition1 = input.groupByKey().mapValues(_.sum)
val definition2 = input.reduceByKey(_ + _)
```

| RDD         | Average time | Min. time | Max. time |
| :---------- | -----------: | --------: | --------: |
| definition1 |     2646.3ms |    1570ms |    8444ms |
| definition2 |      270.7ms |      96ms |    1569ms |

**Lineage (definition1):**

```
(42) MapPartitionsRDD[3] at mapValues at <console>:26 []
 |   ShuffledRDD[2] at groupByKey at <console>:26 []
 +-(42) MapPartitionsRDD[1] at map at <console>:24 []
    |   ParallelCollectionRDD[0] at parallelize at <console>:24 []
```

**Lineage (definition2):**

```

 +-(42) MapPartitionsRDD[1] at map at <console>:24 []
    |   ParallelCollectionRDD[0] at parallelize at <console>:24 []
```

>  The second definition is much faster than the first because it handles data more efficiently in the context of our use case by not collecting all the elements needlessly.

### Apache Spark Azure

2023-10-01 [Azure Storage Data Lake Gen2 Pricing | Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/data-lake/)

> Data transfer prices for ADLS
> When you write data into GRS accounts, that data will be replicated to another Azure region. The Geo-Replication Data Transfer charge is for the bandwidth of replicating that data to another Azure region. This charge also applies when you change the account replication setting from LRS to GRS or RA-GRS. View the Data transfer prices on Blobs pricing page.

➡2023-10-01 [Azure Data Transfer Costs: Everything You Need To Know • CloudMonitor](https://cloudmonitor.ai/2021/08/azure-data-transfer-costs-everything-you-need-to-know/)

> Azure data transfer within the same availability zone is free of charge, while data transfer between two different availability zones now incurs a cost of $0.01 per GB.
> As mentioned earlier, incoming data traffic or data communicating between Azure services within the same region incur no charges. However, charges start to kick in when data is moved across different Azure regions. These charges depend on the amount of data being transmitted and on the zone from where the traffic is originating. For example, if you transfer data between regions within North America (intra-continental data transfer), you will be charged at a $0.02 per GB rate.

### Apache Spark Code Snippets

2023-09-30 [SharedSparkContext · holdenk/spark-testing-base Wiki](https://github.com/holdenk/spark-testing-base/wiki/SharedSparkContext)\

> Instead of initializing `SparkContext` before every test case or per class you can easily get your `SparkContext` by extending `SharedSparkContext`. `SharedSparkContext` initializes `SparkContext` before all test cases and stops this context after all test cases. For Spark 2.2 and higher you can also share the `SparkContext` (and `SparkSession` if in `DataFrame` tests) between tests by adding `override implicit def reuseContextIfPossible: Boolean = true` to your test.

> Good unit testing coverage
>
> In this article we started exploring working with Spark code in Scala from the software engineering perspective. We created a source code repository in Git and configured a CI/CD pipeline for it in GitLab. We integrated the pipeline to push code coverage metrics to CodeCov.io and implemented unit and integration tests to achieve a high level of coverage. In our unit tests, we experimented with object mocking techniques. In the integration test we generated a sample data set and registered it as a table with SparkSession. We enabled Spark integration with Hive in order to allow the test to write transformed data to a Hive table backed by the local file system. In the next article we will continue this exploration by implementing a data conversion for a practical use case.

> The fake recruiter contacted the victim via LinkedIn Messaging, a feature within the LinkedIn professional social networking platform, and sent two coding challenges required as part of a hiring process, which the victim downloaded and executed on a company device. The first challenge is a very basic project that displays the text “Hello, World!”, the second one prints a Fibonacci sequence – a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. ESET Research was able to reconstruct the initial access steps and analyze the toolset used by Lazarus thanks to cooperation with the affected aerospace company.

>  **Aspects of an L63 Contributor**: some random aspects that come to my mind beyond our CSPs:
>
>  - *They can own a room*: they aren't warming a seat but rather can take charge of a conversation and represent such a deep level of knowledge that they gain respect for what they say and earn a good reputation. Their focus stays on accountable results and this person can bring resolution and closure together.
>  - *Expert*: They are sought after to be in meetings, for instance, so that good decisions can be made.
>  - *Results-focused*: they are focused on getting great results and don't entwine their ego to particular solutions. They don't get defensive if their ideas are revealed to have flaws but rather delight in being able to move to a better solution.
>  - *Leadership*: pro-active leadership that convinces team members of the future direction and even helps to implement it. This is a big difference between those who can complain about the way things should be and those you can actually bring it about.
>  - *Solutions, not problems*: following up on the above, they aren't complaining about problems on the team but rather implementing and driving solutions.
>  - *Makes other great*: the team benefits and grows from the person's contributions. Answers questions from the team, from support, from customers. Knows what the team delivers backwards and forwards. They are a good mentor.
>  - *Influence when they can, scare when they must*: they have fundamental skills in influencing people, but if they need to flip into junk-yard dog mode, they can. They don't give up and walk away but rather fight when they need to fight, escalating only when needed and with lots of justification.
>  - *Makes the boss great:* if the team and your boss are succeeding because of you, of course you'll be succeeding too.
>  - *Not doing it for the promotion*: if you're out for a promotion, don't do work specifically chose to get the promotion. This is like meeting the Buddha on the road. If you come up with a pretty plan to justify your promotion, you've already lost it. Such plotting is obvious and actually detrimental to your career. If, however, you've determined what it takes to have a successful career in your group at Microsoft and have started what you need to start and stopped what you need to stop, then you're on the right path.
