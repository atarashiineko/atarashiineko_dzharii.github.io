## Projects

2023-10-03 [orhun/daktilo: Turn your keyboard into a typewriter! 📇](https://github.com/orhun/daktilo)

> On one side, this is a project with a useless (but funny) goal. On the other side -- this is an awesome sample of cross-platform system app. 
>
> **daktilo** ("typewriter" in Turkish, pronounced *"duck-til-oh"*, derived from the Ancient Greek word [δάκτυλος](https://lsj.gr/wiki/δάκτυλος) for "finger") is a small command-line program that plays typewriter sounds every time you press a key. It also offers the flexibility to customize keypress sounds to your liking. You can use the built-in sound presets to create an enjoyable typing experience, whether you're crafting emails or up to some prank on your boss.

> Delving deeper into configurations, the article illuminates the necessity of nested configurations for different project layers, advocating for as many TypeScript files as there are layers. This granularity is essential to avoid "unleashing hundreds of ghostly types" and ensuring precise type-checking. As development tools evolve, and while frameworks might abstract complexities, it's emphasized that "TypeScript is still your tool," urging developers to grasp its depths and nuances.

## Security holes

2023-10-01 [Lazarus luring employees with trojanized coding challenges: The case of a Spanish aerospace company](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/lazarus-luring-employees-trojanized-coding-challenges-case-spanish-aerospace-company/)

> The fake recruiter contacted the victim via LinkedIn Messaging, a feature within the LinkedIn professional social networking platform, and sent two coding challenges required as part of a hiring process, which the victim downloaded and executed on a company device. The first challenge is a very basic project that displays the text “Hello, World!”, the second one prints a Fibonacci sequence – a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. ESET Research was able to reconstruct the initial access steps and analyze the toolset used by Lazarus thanks to cooperation with the affected aerospace company.



## MS-Files

2023-10-02 ✨✨ 2008!!✨✨ [Mini-Microsoft: Achieving Senior Level 63 at Microsoft](https://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/11/achieving-senior-level-63-at-microsoft.html)

>  ![image-20231003170638449](./2023-10-03-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231003170638449.png)
>  **Aspects of an L63 Contributor**: some random aspects that come to my mind beyond our CSPs:
>
>  - *They can own a room*: they aren't warming a seat but rather can take charge of a conversation and represent such a deep level of knowledge that they gain respect for what they say and earn a good reputation. Their focus stays on accountable results and this person can bring resolution and closure together.
>  - *Expert*: They are sought after to be in meetings, for instance, so that good decisions can be made.
>  - *Results-focused*: they are focused on getting great results and don't entwine their ego to particular solutions. They don't get defensive if their ideas are revealed to have flaws but rather delight in being able to move to a better solution.
>  - *Leadership*: pro-active leadership that convinces team members of the future direction and even helps to implement it. This is a big difference between those who can complain about the way things should be and those you can actually bring it about.
>  - *Solutions, not problems*: following up on the above, they aren't complaining about problems on the team but rather implementing and driving solutions.
>  - *Makes other great*: the team benefits and grows from the person's contributions. Answers questions from the team, from support, from customers. Knows what the team delivers backwards and forwards. They are a good mentor.
>  - *Influence when they can, scare when they must*: they have fundamental skills in influencing people, but if they need to flip into junk-yard dog mode, they can. They don't give up and walk away but rather fight when they need to fight, escalating only when needed and with lots of justification.
>  - *Makes the boss great:* if the team and your boss are succeeding because of you, of course you'll be succeeding too.
>  - *Not doing it for the promotion*: if you're out for a promotion, don't do work specifically chose to get the promotion. This is like meeting the Buddha on the road. If you come up with a pretty plan to justify your promotion, you've already lost it. Such plotting is obvious and actually detrimental to your career. If, however, you've determined what it takes to have a successful career in your group at Microsoft and have started what you need to start and stopped what you need to stop, then you're on the right path.
