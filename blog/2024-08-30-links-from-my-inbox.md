## Security

2024-08-31 [The State of Application Security 2023 • Sebastian Brandes • GOTO 2023 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX0TVzHOJgQ) { www.youtube.com }

> Sebastian, co-founder of **Hey Hack**, a Danish startup focused on **web application security**, presented findings from a large-scale study involving the scanning of nearly 4 million hosts globally. The study uncovered widespread vulnerabilities in web applications, including **file leaks, dangling DNS records, vulnerable FTP servers,** and persistent **cross-site scripting (XSS) issues**.
>
> Key findings include:
>
> - **File leaks**: 29% of organizations had exposed sensitive data like source code, passwords, and private keys.
> - **Dangling DNS records**: Risks of **subdomain takeover** attacks due to outdated DNS entries.
> - **Vulnerable FTP servers**: 7.9% of servers running **ProFTPD 1.3.5** were at risk due to a file copy module vulnerability.
> - **XSS vulnerabilities**: 4% of companies had known XSS issues, posing significant security risks.
>
> Sebastian stressed that **web application firewalls (WAFs)** are not foolproof and cannot replace fixing underlying vulnerabilities. He concluded by emphasizing the importance of early investment in **application security** during the development process to prevent future attacks.
>
> > "We’ve seen lots of leaks or file leaks that are sitting out there—files that you probably would not want to expose to the public internet."
>
> > "Web application firewalls can maybe do something, but they’re not going to save you. It’s much, much better to go ahead and fix the actual issues in your application."
