## Security

> Sebastian, co-founder of **Hey Hack**, a Danish startup focused on **web application security**, presented findings from a large-scale study involving the scanning of nearly 4 million hosts globally. The study uncovered widespread vulnerabilities in web applications, including **file leaks, dangling DNS records, vulnerable FTP servers,** and persistent **cross-site scripting (XSS) issues**.
>
> Key findings include:
>
> - **File leaks**: 29% of organizations had exposed sensitive data like source code, passwords, and private keys.
> - **Dangling DNS records**: Risks of **subdomain takeover** attacks due to outdated DNS entries.
> - **Vulnerable FTP servers**: 7.9% of servers running **ProFTPD 1.3.5** were at risk due to a file copy module vulnerability.
> - **XSS vulnerabilities**: 4% of companies had known XSS issues, posing significant security risks.
>
> Sebastian stressed that **web application firewalls (WAFs)** are not foolproof and cannot replace fixing underlying vulnerabilities. He concluded by emphasizing the importance of early investment in **application security** during the development process to prevent future attacks.
>
> > "We’ve seen lots of leaks or file leaks that are sitting out there—files that you probably would not want to expose to the public internet."
>
> > "Web application firewalls can maybe do something, but they’re not going to save you. It’s much, much better to go ahead and fix the actual issues in your application."

> The other problem with goals is that, outside of sports, “goal” has become an uninspiring, institutional word. Goals are things your teachers and managers have for you. Goals are made of quotas and Key Performance Indicators. As soon as I write the word “goals” on a sheet of paper I get drowsy.

> ![image-20240901012420483](./2024-08-30-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240901012420483.png)
>
> The talk presented here dives into the integration of **AI** within applications, particularly focusing on how developers, especially those familiar with .NET and web technologies, can leverage AI to enhance user experiences. Here are the key takeaways and approaches from the session:
>
> **Making Applications Intelligent**: The speaker discusses various interpretations of making an app "intelligent." It’s not just about adding a chatbot. While chatbots can create impressive demos quickly, they may not necessarily be useful in production. For AI to be genuinely beneficial, it must save time, improve job performance, and be accurate. The speaker challenges developers to quantify these benefits rather than rely on assumptions.
>
> > "If you try to put it into production, are people going to actually use it? Well, maybe it depends... does this thing actually save people time and enable them to do their job better than they would have otherwise?"
>
> **Patterns of AI Integration**: The speaker introduces several **UI-level AI enhancements** such as **Smart Components**. These are experiments allowing developers to add AI to the UI layer without needing to rebuild the entire app. An example given is a **Smart Paste** feature that allows users to paste large chunks of text, which AI then parses and fills out the corresponding fields in a form. This feature improves user efficiency by reducing the need for repetitive and mundane tasks.
>
> Another example is the **Smart ComboBox**, which uses **semantic search** to match user input with relevant categories, even when the exact terms do not appear in the list. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where users may not know the exact terminology.
>
> **Deeper AI Integration**: Moving beyond UI enhancements, the speaker explores deeper layers of AI integration within traditional web applications like e-commerce platforms. For instance, AI can be used to:
>
> - **Semantic Search**: Improve search functionality so that users don't need to know the exact phrasing.
> - **Summarization**: Automatically generate descriptive titles for support tickets to help staff quickly identify issues.
> - **Classification**: Automatically categorize support tickets to streamline workflows and save staff time.
> - **Sentiment Analysis**: Provide sentiment scores to help staff prioritize urgent issues.
>
> > "I think even in this very traditional web application, there's clearly lots of opportunity for AI to add a lot of genuine value that will help your staff actually be more productive."
>
> **Data and AI Integration**: The talk also delves into the importance of data in AI applications. The speaker introduces the **Semantic Kernel**, a .NET library for working with AI, and demonstrates how to generate data using **LLMs (Large Language Models)** locally on the development machine using **Ollama**. The process involves creating categories, products, and related data (like product manuals) in a structured manner.
>
> **Data Ingestion and Semantic Search**: The speaker showcases how to ingest unstructured data, such as PDFs, and convert them into a format that AI can use for semantic search. Using the **PDFPig** library, the speaker demonstrates extracting text from PDFs, chunking it into smaller, meaningful fragments, and then embedding these chunks into a **semantic space**. This allows for efficient, relevant searches within the data, enhancing the AI’s ability to provide accurate information quickly.
>
> **Implementing Inference with AI**: As the talk progresses, the speaker moves on to implementing AI-based inference within a **Blazor** application. By integrating **summarization** directly into the workflow, the application can automatically generate summaries of customer interactions, helping support staff to quickly understand the context of a ticket without reading through the entire conversation history.
>
> > "I want to generate an updated summary for it... Generate a summary of the entire conversation log at that point."
>
> **Function Calling and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: The speaker discusses a more complex AI pattern—**RAG**—which involves the AI model retrieving specific data to answer queries. While standard RAG implementations rely on specific AI platforms, the speaker demonstrates a custom approach that works across various models, including locally run models like **Ollama**. This approach involves checking if the AI has enough context to answer a question and then retrieving relevant information if needed.
