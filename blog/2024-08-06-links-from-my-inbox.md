2024-06-18 [A Long Guide to Giving a Short Academic Talk - Benjamin Noble](https://benjaminnoble.org/blog/short-talk)

> ### Anatomy of a Short Talk
>
> Short academic talks tend to follow a standard format:
>
> - Motivation of the general idea. This can take the form of an illustrative example from the real world or it can highlight a puzzle or gap in the existing scholarship.
> - Ask the research question and preview your answer.
> - A few brief references to the literature you’re speaking to.
> - Your theoretical innovation.
> - An overview of the data underlying the result.
> - Descriptive statistics (if relevant).
> - (Maybe the statistical approach or model, but only if it’s something impressive and/or non-standard. The less Greek the better.)
> - Statistical results IN FIGURE FORM! No regression tables please.
> - Conclusion that restates your main finding. Then, briefly reference your other results (which you have in your appendix slides and would be happy to discuss further in Q&A), and highlight the broader implications of your research.

2024-06-29 [A Bunch of Programming Advice I’d Give To Myself 15 Years Ago - Marcus' Blog](https://mbuffett.com/posts/programming-advice-younger-self/)

> **If you (or your team) are shooting yourselves in the foot constantly, fix the gun**
>
> Regularly identify and fix recurring issues in your workflow or codebase to simplify processes and reduce errors. Don't wait for an onboarding or major overhaul to address these problems.
>
> **Assess the trade-off you’re making between quality and pace, make sure it’s appropriate for your context**
>
> Evaluate the balance between speed and correctness based on the project's impact and environment. In non-critical applications, prioritize faster shipping and quicker fixes over exhaustive testing.
>
> **Spending time sharpening the axe is almost always worth it**
>
> Invest time in becoming proficient with your tools and environment. Learn shortcuts, become a fast typist, and know your editor and OS well. This efficiency pays off in the long run.
>
> **If you can’t easily explain why something is difficult, then it’s incidental complexity, which is probably worth addressing**
>
> Simplify or refactor complex code that can't be easily explained. This reduces future maintenance and makes your system more robust.
>
> **Try to solve bugs one layer deeper**
>
> Address the root cause of bugs rather than applying superficial fixes. This approach results in a cleaner, more maintainable system.
>
> **Don’t underestimate the value of digging into history to investigate some bugs**
>
> Use version control history to trace the origin of bugs. Tools like `git bisect` can be invaluable for pinpointing changes that introduced issues.
>
> **Bad code gives you feedback, perfect code doesn’t. Err on the side of writing bad code**
>
> Write code quickly to get feedback, even if it’s not perfect. This helps you learn where to focus your efforts and improves overall productivity.
>
> **Make debugging easier**
>
> Implement debugging aids such as user data replication, detailed tracing, and state debugging. These tools streamline the debugging process and reduce time spent on issues.
>
> **When working on a team, you should usually ask the question**
>
> Don’t hesitate to ask more experienced colleagues for help. It’s often more efficient than struggling alone and fosters a collaborative environment.
>
> **Shipping cadence matters a lot. Think hard about what will get you shipping quickly and often**
>
> Optimize your workflow to ensure frequent and fast releases. Simplify processes, use reusable patterns, and maintain a system free of excessive bugs to improve shipping speed.

> Found in 2024-07-15 [Ten Years with Microservices :: Programming Digest](https://newsletter.programmingdigest.net/p/ten-years-microservices/)
>
> I retired in 2021 after 40 years as a programmer, not because I couldn't keep up but because I lost interest. Careers evolve, and everyone eventually reaches a point where they can no longer continue as they have. This isn't just about retirement; it can happen anytime. Some people become obsolete due to outdated technology, lose passion, or are forced out by market changes.
>
> Sustaining a long programming career is challenging due to rapid technological shifts. Many of my peers either moved into management or became obsolete. It's essential to be honest with yourself about your ability to keep up and your job satisfaction. Sometimes, leaving programming or transitioning to a different field can bring greater fulfillment.
>
> > "Are you keeping up to date sufficiently to continue the job? Is the job even interesting anymore, or is there something else you would rather do?"
>
> Making informed career decisions is crucial. Age and ability are not necessarily correlated, and personal fulfillment should take priority over financial reasons. Even in retirement, I continue to write code for my generative art practice, finding joy in the complexity and creativity it offers.
>
> > "Programming can be a fun career, a horrible nightmare, or something in between, and it never stands still."
>
> Evaluate your career honestly, be open to change, and explore new opportunities when the current path no longer suits you.

2024-07-14 [Failure & Change: Principles of Reliable Systems • Mark Hibberd • YOW! 2018 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgDIpEMZenk)

> ![image-20240806225909552](./2024-08-06-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240806225909552.png)
>
> Mark Hibberd's talk "Failure & Change: Principles of **Reliable Systems**" at YOW! 2018 explores building and operating **reliable software systems**, focusing on understanding and managing **failures** in **complex and large-scale systems**.
>
> **Reliability** is defined as consistently performing well. Using **airline engines** as an example, Hibberd illustrates how opting for fewer engines can sometimes be safer due to lower **failure probability** and fewer **knock-on effects**. The key is to control the **scope** and **consequences of failures**.
>
> > "We need to be resilient to failure by controlling the scope and consequences of our failure."
>
> **Redundancy** and **independence** are crucial. Redundancy should be managed carefully to maintain reliability, avoiding tightly coupled systems where a single failure can cascade into multiple failures. **Service granularity** helps manage failures effectively by breaking down systems into smaller, independent services, each handling specific responsibilities and passing values around to maintain independence.
>
> > "Service granularity gives us this opportunity to trade the likelihood of a failure for the consequences of a failure."
>
> In operations, it's essential to implement **health checks** and **monitoring** to detect failures early and **route around them aggressively** to prevent overload and cascading failures. Using **circuit breakers** to cut off communication to failing services allows them to recover.
>
> Designing systems with **independent services** is key. Services should operate independently, using shared values rather than shared states or dependencies. For example, an online chess service can be broken down into services for **pairing**, **playing**, **history**, and **analysis**, each maintaining independence.
>
> Operational strategies include implementing **timeouts** and **retries** to handle slow responses and prevent overloads, and deploying new versions gradually to test against real traffic and verify responses. **Proxies** can interact with unreliable code to maintain a reliable view of data.
>
> > "Timeouts are so important that we probably should have some sort of government-sponsored public service announcement."
>
> **Handling change** in complex systems involves accommodating changes without significant disruptions through continuous deployment and rolling updates. Techniques like **in-production verification** and routing requests to both old and new versions during deployment help ensure reliability.
>
> **Data management** is also crucial. Separating data storage from application logic helps maintain reliability during changes. Avoid coupling data handling directly with services to facilitate easier updates and rollbacks.
>
> > "We want to create situations where we can gracefully roll things out and flatten out this time dimension."
>
> Hibberd emphasizes making informed trade-offs in **architecture**, **redundancy**, and **granularity** to enhance the reliability of software systems. Continuous monitoring, strategic failure handling, and incremental deployment are essential to ensure systems remain resilient and reliable despite inevitable failures and changes.



## 🤖 The Era of AI

2024-07-01 [The limitations of LLMs, or why are we doing RAG? | EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/limitations-llm-or-why-are-we-doing-rag)

>![image-20240806230126557](./2024-08-06-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240806230126557.png)
>
>Despite powerful capabilities with many tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) are not know-it-alls. If you've used ChatGPT or other models, you'll have experienced how they can’t reasonably answer questions about proprietary information. What’s worse, it isn’t just that they don't know about proprietary information, they are unaware of their own limitations and, even if they were aware, they don’t have access to proprietary information. That's where options like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) come in and give LLMs the ability to incorporate new and proprietary information into their answers.

>
> **It’s Just Adding One Word at a Time**
> That ChatGPT can automatically generate something that reads even superficially like human-written text is remarkable, and unexpected. But how does it do it? And why does it work? My purpose here is to give a rough outline of what’s going on inside ChatGPT—and then to explore why it is that it can do so well in producing what we might consider to be meaningful text. I should say at the outset that I’m going to focus on the big picture of what’s going on—and while I’ll mention some engineering details, I won’t get deeply into them. (And the essence of what I’ll say applies just as well to other current “large language models” [LLMs] as to ChatGPT.)
>
> The first thing to explain is that what ChatGPT is always fundamentally trying to do is to produce a “reasonable continuation” of whatever text it’s got so far, where by “reasonable” we mean “what one might expect someone to write after seeing what people have written on billions of webpages, etc.”

> **Be Positive**
>
> - ✅ Do this: "Explain how to implement a sorting algorithm."
> - ❌ Don't do this: "Don't talk about unrelated algorithms."
> - *Example*: Nike was on the right track when they said, "Just do it." Telling a prompt what not to do can lead it to do just that.
>
> **Give the Model an Out**
>
> - ✅ Do this: "If you don't know the answer, it's okay to say 'I don't know.'"
> - ❌ Don't do this: "You must provide an answer for every question."
> - *Let the model say 'I don’t know' to reduce hallucinations.*
>
> **Break Complex Tasks into Subtasks**
>
> - ✅ Do this: "Write three statements for and against using AI in education. Then use those statements to write an essay."
> - ❌ Don't do this: "Write an essay on AI in education."
> - *Example*: For an essay, ask the AI to write three statements for and against a point. Then have it use those statements to write the essay.
>
> **Ask for Its Chain of Thought**
>
> - ✅ Do this: "Explain why you think using AI can improve customer service."
> - ❌ Don't do this: "Just tell me how AI can improve customer service without any explanation."
> - *Ask it to explain its reasoning. Lately, it seems GPT-4 does this automatically.*
>
> **Check the Model’s Comprehension**
>
> - ✅ Do this: "Do you understand the task of generating a summary of this article?"
> - ❌ Don't do this: "Summarize this article without confirming if you understood the task."
> - *"Do you understand the task?"*
