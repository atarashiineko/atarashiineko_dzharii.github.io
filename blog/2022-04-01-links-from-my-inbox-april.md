> In a recent post, Parrhesia suggested that course grades should be 100% determined by performance on a final exam—an exam that could be taken repeatedly, with the last attempt being the course grade. (See also the discussion at r/slatestarcodex.) The idea is that grades are supposed to measure what you know, and if you do well on a final, then you know the material.

> Given a new platform it is only natural to think of porting Doom to it. With 264K of RAM, two CortexM0+ CPUs and a decent clock speed, the RP2040 is certainly not the tightest platform Doom has ever been ported to - although at <$1 it is probably one of the cheapest - so I wanted to set my self a more aggressive set of goals...

> .NET provides a lot of great collections types like `List<T>`, `Dictionary<T>`, and `HashSet<T>`. All those collections have dynamic size capacity. That means they automatically expand in size as you add more items.
    - Set initial capacity for dynamic collections
    - Use ArrayPool for short-lived large arrays
    - Use Structs instead of Classes (sometimes)
    - Avoid Finalizers
    - Use StackAlloc for short-lived array allocations
    - Use StringBuilder, but not always
    - Use String Interning in very specific cases
    - Avoid memory leaks
    - Summary:
        - Allocations should be avoided if possible.
        - Reusing memory is better than allocating new memory.
        - Allocating on the Stack is faster than allocating on the Heap.

    - It’s a legacy platform
    - The tooling is expensive
    - .NET isn’t open source friendly
    - It’s for boomer enterprise development
- 2022-03-13 Go vs C# (by Alex Yakunin) I am going to write a series of posts comparing some features of Go and C#. The core feature of Go — goroutines — is actually a very good point to start from. C#’s alternative for this is Task Parallel Library (TPL) and async-await support.
