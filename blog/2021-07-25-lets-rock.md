Dear Diary,

I remember, 8 years ago, back in Ukraine, I've used to run even several blogs.
Blogging was super helpful since I've been able to blog about my findings or results of my research and then find that note after some time. I've met a few like-minded friends because of my posts. This is a great tool. But then… I've stopped.

Because my English isn't perfect…
Because of lack of time, other things, video games…

Finally: the circle is now complete. I have not fixed all my issues before I have re-started the blogging, but, really, should I?

This is my official first post. I don't know what I will do in the future, but I am going to publish this right now.
