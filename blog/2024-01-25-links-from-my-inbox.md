I created [Coravel](https://github.com/jamesmh/coravel) as an easy way to build .NET applications with more advanced web application features. But it’s mostly known as a background job scheduling library.

> I thought it would be fun to play around with the idea of building a basic CRON job system and progressively building it into a more high-performance CRON job processing system.

> We’ll start by learning how to use Coravel in a simple scenario. Then, we’ll further configure and leverage Coravel’s features to squeeze more performance out of a single .NET process. Finally, you’ll learn a few advanced techniques to build a high-performance background job processing system.

> Consider a file named ‘Notes.txt’ you open this and guess what? You see the content of it, which in this case, is any kind of text you wrote inside. However, computers don’t see ‘text’ per se. They interpret everything as binary data, which is essentially a series of 1s and 0s. This binary data, in the case of a ‘.txt’ file, represents the ASCII code of each character, which ranges from 0 to 255. For instance, the ASCII representation for ‘B’ is 01000010, ‘o’ is 01101111, and ‘b’ is 01100010. Thus, ‘Bob’ in your .txt file is represented as 01000010 01101111 01100010 (without spaces).
