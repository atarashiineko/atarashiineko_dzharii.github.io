## Algorithms

2024-03-28 [Binary array set](https://www.nayuki.io/page/binary-array-set)

> Despite the lack of deletion functionality, the data structure is still useful in applications that only add and test but donâ€™t delete â€“ for example, breadth-first search maintains an ever-growing set of visited nodes that shouldnâ€™t be revisited. To compare time complexities with a popular alternative, a balanced binary search tree takes worst-case Î˜(log n) time alike for adding, testing, or removing one element.

2024-04-17 [Solving the minimum cut problem for undirected graphs](https://research.google/blog/solving-the-minimum-cut-problem-for-undirected-graphs/)

> In the study "Deterministic Near-Linear Time Minimum Cut in Weighted  Graphs," the new approach to solving the minimum cut problem in weighted graphs hinges on an advanced form of **cut-preserving graph sparsification**. This technique meticulously reduces the original graph into a sparser  version by strategically creating well-connected clusters of nodes that  align with potential minimum cuts. These clusters are then contracted  into single nodes, effectively simplifying the graph's complexity while  maintaining the integrity of its critical structural properties. This  method allows the algorithm to maintain deterministic accuracy and  operate efficiently, providing a significant improvement over previous  methods that were either limited to simpler graphs or relied on  probabilistic outcomes.
