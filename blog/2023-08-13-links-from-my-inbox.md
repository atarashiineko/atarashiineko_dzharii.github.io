## Good Reads

2023-08-13 [Moving faster](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/moving-faster/)
> >  From 2023-08-13 [Programming Digest](https://programmingdigest.net/digests/1695)
>
> A list of tools that help to work faster. The caveat here is that you need to spend a lot of time learning and mastering the tools; only then will the tools help you. It is a gradual everyday process rather than one-day learning.  
>
> - **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learning the keyboard shortcuts for your favorite IDE or editor, as well as for your operating system, can significantly speed up your workflow. These become automatic over time, allowing you to perform complex actions without thinking.
>
> - **Code Syntax**: Familiarity with the syntax of the language you're working in makes writing code a lot smoother. It becomes a low-level skill when you no longer have to think about the basic structure of loops, conditionals, etc., and can focus on the logic you're implementing.
>
> - **Testing Frameworks**: If you're using automated testing (and you should be), learning your testing framework inside and out enables you to quickly write and run tests without having to stop and think about how to do it. This enhances your ability to perform TDD (Test Driven Development) or other testing methodologies without a hitch.
>
> - **Debugging Techniques**: Understanding the ins and outs of your debugging tools and how to quickly diagnose common problems in your code can become a low-level skill. Knowing how to efficiently use breakpoints, inspect variables, and utilize other debugging features saves a lot of time.
>
> - **Git Commands**: If you're using Git or a similar version control system, becoming fluent in common commands enables you to manage your codebase efficiently. Committing, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts can become automatic processes.
>
> - **Touch Typing**: This is a fundamental skill for any professional who spends a significant amount of time on a computer. Being able to type without looking at the keys allows your thoughts to flow directly onto the screen, greatly enhancing your efficiency.
>
> - **Use of Snippets and Templates**: Many editors and IDEs allow you to define snippets or templates for code that you write frequently. This could be something as simple as the boilerplate for a class definition or as complex as a full file template. Being adept at using these can save a lot of time and effort.
>
> - **Build Tools and Automation**: Understanding how to automate repetitive tasks using build tools, scripts, and other automation techniques is a vital low-level skill. It allows you to focus on the higher-level aspects of your work, knowing that the lower-level tasks are handled efficiently.
>
> By turning these into automatic processes, you free up cognitive resources to focus on higher-level problem-solving and decision-making. It can be highly beneficial to invest the time and effort into mastering these low-level skills, as they'll pay off in the long run by enhancing your efficiency, reducing mistakes, and allowing you to produce better-quality code more quickly.
>
> A good practice for developing these skills is to identify areas where you feel you are slowing down or getting stuck frequently and deliberately practice those specific tasks until they become second nature. Whether it's through deliberate practice, reading documentation, or seeking tutorials and guidance, investing in these low-level skills will have long-lasting benefits in your coding career.

In the context of authentication and authorization, these acronyms refer to specific standards and protocols. Here's an overview:

1. **JAR (JWT-Secured Authorization Request):**
   - **Description**: JAR is a method to secure OAuth 2.0 authorization requests using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This allows the client to send requests in a way that ensures integrity and possibly confidentiality of the authorization request parameters.
   - **Use**: It's used to protect the content of the authorization request, thus increasing the security of the OAuth 2.0 flow.

2. **PAR (Pushed Authorization Request):**
   - **Description**: PAR enables the client to request authorization from the authorization server without exposing the parameters to the end-user's user-agent. It essentially allows the parameters to be sent directly to the authorization server, returning a URL that the user-agent can be redirected to.
   - **Use**: This enhances the security of the OAuth 2.0 authorization process by reducing exposure of sensitive parameters to possibly malicious user-agents or intermediaries.

3. **RAR (Rich Authorization Requests):**
   - **Description**: RAR is an extension to OAuth 2.0 that provides a way for clients to convey a fine-grained authorization request, using a structured format, both for scope and other authorization parameters.
   - **Use**: This allows for a more detailed and flexible authorization request, suitable for various complex use cases that require more than the basic scopes.

4. **FAPI2 (Financial-grade API Part 2 - Advanced Financial-grade API):**
   - **Description**: FAPI2 is a set of security profiles for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, designed for high-risk scenarios like financial services and payments. It specifies various security requirements and recommendations to ensure that the authorization process is highly secure.
   - **Use**: It's used to provide robust security measures specifically for financial APIs, where high levels of security are needed.

In summary, these terms are all related to enhancing and extending the security and functionality of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, particularly in scenarios that require high levels of security, such as in financial services.

>  2023-08-06 [YARP Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/)
> We found a bunch of internal teams at Microsoft who were either building a reverse proxy for their service or had been asking about APIs and tech for building one, so we decided to get them all together to work on a common solution, this project. Each of these projects was doing something slightly off the beaten path which meant they were not well served by existing proxies, and customization of those proxies had a high cost and ongoing maintenance considerations.
