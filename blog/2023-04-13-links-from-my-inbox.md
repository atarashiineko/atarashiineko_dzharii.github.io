2023-04-09 [How to stop ruminating - by George Sudarkoff](https://www.sudarkoff.blog/p/how-to-stop-ruminating)

> Rumination is when our minds latch onto a story and just won’t let go, going on and on about it. It’s exhausting! Distracting yourself is fairly common advice, but it’s a bit like trying to ignore a splinter. Maybe it’ll get dislodged from your body and get washed down the drain when you’re showering. But until that happens, it keeps reminding you about itself. Worse yet, it might get inflamed and cause more problems down the line.
>
> Here’s a more productive approach that allowed so many of my clients to get lasting relief from rumination:
>
> 1. Pay attention to the triggers.
> 2. Examine the stories you’re telling yourself, and identify the cognitive distortions your mind might be employing.
> 3. Don’t believe everything you think.
> 4. Practice self-compassion.
> 5. Realize that it’s a practice.

> [Russ Harris](https://www.amazon.com/ACT-Made-Simple-Easy-Read/dp/1684033012), author of several popular ACT books, offers a framework of 7 "R"s that can help support action in its early stages:
>
> - **Reminders** - using apps, timers, or other means to remind us of the new behavior
> - **Records** - keeping track of our behavior throughout the day
> - **Rewards** - giving ourselves positive reinforcement for engaging in a behavior
> - **Routines** - building the new behavior around an existing daily habit
> - **Relationships** - finding a friend to do the new behavior with, or who you can talk to about the progress you’re making
> - **Reflecting** - taking time to reflect on the progress you’re making through journaling, discussion with a friend, or in your mind
> - **Restructuring** - making changes to the environment to make it easier to do the new behavior – i.e., throwing out unhealthy food or preparing at night for a morning run

2023-03-24 [Laying Out a Print Book With CSS | Ian G McDowell's Blog](https://iangmcdowell.com/blog/posts/laying-out-a-book-with-css/)

> Basic Layout

> It still looks like a web-page, it’s time to apply some print conventions. The chapter headings need some room, and maybe a sweet underline. The body text should be a column, with indented paragraphs. That kind of stuff.
>
> A note on my CSS: Yes, I’m all over the place with my units (Inches! Pixels! Points! Ems!), and there’s no rhyme or reason to the order of my declarations. In my defense: it doesn’t matter. I’m not going to prod with this. No one’s going to be stuck maintaining it. And, god willing, I’ll never have to extend it. But you’re welcome to clean it up for use in your own project.

> Component redundancy is used heavily in safety-critical and mission-critical systems for reliability improvement. But outside this niche, it's surprisingly little known in the world of software. Which is a shame since it's a simple but economical idea. It costs nothing to keep in mind, and it saves you a lot on hotfixes and emergency repairs.

>
> *Learn about the science behind the current exploration of the solar system in this free class. Use principles from physics, chemistry, biology, and geology to understand the latest from Mars, comprehend the outer solar system, ponder planets outside our solar system, and search for habitability in our neighborhood and beyond. This course is generally taught at an advanced level assuming a prior knowledge of undergraduate math and physics, but the majority of the concepts and lectures can be understood without these prerequisites. The quizzes and final exam are designed to make you think critically about the material you have learned rather than to simply make you memorize facts. The class is expected to be challenging but rewarding.*
>
> It is also taught at Caltech, see https://mikebrown.caltech.edu/teaching/science-solar-system
>
> Databases by prof. Widom, from Stanford. Currently the course is at edX, and split into 5 mini-courses. Everything in the course is well thought out and apparently polished and perfected over years of teaching practice and experience. There is nothing useless in the video lectures, and the course homework probes every topic from the lectures.
