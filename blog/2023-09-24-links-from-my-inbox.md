2023-09-24 [7 simple habits of the top 1% of engineers](https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/7-simple-habits-of-the-top-1-of-engineers/)
> Found in 2023-09-24 [Programming Digest](https://programmingdigest.net/digests/1715)
> 1. **Engineering over Coding**
>    - Writing code is a means to an end, a creative pursuit aimed at solving problems for humans.
>    - Outstanding engineers focus on products and solutions, maintaining a mindset oriented towards the end-users.
> 2. **Human-Centric Code**
>    - Code should be written for humans—team members and users—ensuring it's understandable and maintains value to all audiences.
>    - Engineers should be detached from the code, valuing change delivery over perfection and acknowledging the transient nature of code.
> 3. **Consistency and Simplicity**
>    - Maintaining consistent coding standards and style is crucial for scalability and readability.
>    - Writing simple, clean, organized, and logical code, even if complex to produce, ensures the code is aesthetically pleasing and understandable.
> 4. **Predictability and Testing**
>    - Code should not produce surprises and should be predictable through following principles and proper testing.
>    - Various tests from unit to end-to-end tests ensure functionality and provide confidence in code modifications.
> 5. **Communication**
>    - Collaboration and frequent communication are essential, allowing for design reviews, feedback, and iterations on initial designs to achieve better results.
> 6. **Balanced Pacing and Mindful Rule Adherence**
>    - Efficient engineering involves a balanced approach to coding speed, applying principles meticulously to avoid setbacks.
>    - Not all coding situations conform to established rules and principles; mindful deviations, properly documented, are necessary, maintaining code that is consistent, clean, understandable, testable, and valuable.
> 7. **Domain Expertise and Visibility**
>    - Exceptional engineers often have deep knowledge in at least one field and are known for their expertise and value within their teams, achieved through strategic self-marketing and involvement in high-impact projects.

2023-09-23 [It's okay to Make Something Nobody Wants](https://zhangluyao.com/blog/make-something-nobody-wants/)

> Products reflect the creator's emotions, often resonating more deeply with users when born from genuine interest. True innovation stems from authentic self-expression rather than merely anticipating user needs.

2023-09-01 🍒 [How to Speak Up About Ethical Issues at Work](https://hbr.org/2015/06/how-to-speak-up-about-ethical-issues-at-work)
> “A better place to start would be to ask questions instead of making assertions,” Detert explains. Use phrases like: **“Can you help me understand…”** or **“Can you help me see why you’re not worried…”** Detert points to two reasons why this approach works. First, he says, “there’s a possibility that the person isn’t aware they’re doing something wrong and your questioning might allow them to see the problem.” Second, asking questions is “a reasonably safe way to determine if the target is going to be open to discussing this issue or whether you need to pursue another avenue.”
>
> Principles to Remember
> Do:
> - Seek to understand your colleague’s perspective ­— why is she acting the way she is?
> - Consider the benefits of speaking up against the potential consequences
> - Rehearse what you’re going to say before calling out unethical behavior
>
> Don’t:
>
> - Rationalize the behavior just because you’re afraid of having a tough conversation
> - Go straight to your boss or HR unless the situation is severe ­— try talking directly to your colleague first
> - Make moral accusations ­— ask questions and treat the initial conversation as information-gathering

> - ***Why?** —* A manual script was run to remove one account, but all accounts were removed.
> - ***Why?** —* Because Terry had an error in his script, the WHERE clause was commented out.
> - ***Why?*** — While Terry was working on the script, someone interrupted him and started scolding him in front of everybody.
> - ***Why?** —* He messed up another data script earlier that week, and QA found the error and escalated it to a manager.
> - ***Why?*** — People make mistakes, and Terry puts up with being scolded.
> - ***Why?*** — He thinks he deserves it.
> - ***Why?** —* His relationship with his mother robbed him of belief in his own power and agency.
> - ***Why?** —* Children are very receptive to negative feedback between ages 5 to 13, and parents, through exhaustion, impatience, or anger, can accidentally cause a child to think that something is fundamentally wrong with themselves.
> - ***Why?*** — When we are small, it is much easier to think of ourselves as weak than that those who care for and protect us are weak.
> - ***Root Cause:*** Terry has not dealt with his emotional trauma and doesn’t really know who he is.

> - **Complexity kills**: software industry is suffering from a culture of over-engineering and unnecessary complexity, especially with the widespread adoption of microservices and distributed systems. It claims that most companies do not need such architectures and would benefit from simpler, monolithic solutions that are easier to develop, test, and maintain.
> - **Context matters**: blindly following the practices of large tech companies like Google or Amazon, which have very different problems and resources than most startups. It suggests that developers should focus on solving the actual problem at hand, rather than imitating what they think is “web scale” or “cutting edge”.
> - **Trade-offs exist**: there are advantages and disadvantages to any design choice, and that there is no silver bullet for software engineering. It urges developers to be aware of the costs and benefits of microservices, such as increased boilerplate,

> If I give a programmer a string such as `"9223372036854775808"` and I ask them to convert it to an integer, they might do the following in C++:

```cpp
std::string s = ....
uint64_t val;
auto [ptr, ec] =
std::from_chars(s.data(), s.data() + s.size(), val);
if (ec != std::errc()) {} // I have an error !
// val holds the value
```

>  It is very fast: you can parse a sequence of random 32-bit integers at about 40 cycles per integer, using about 128 instructions.
