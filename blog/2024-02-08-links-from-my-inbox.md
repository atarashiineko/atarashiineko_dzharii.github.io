2024-01-27 [Long Term Refactors - Max Chernyak](https://max.engineer/long-term-refactors)

> I have a theory that long refactors get a bad rap because most of them take far longer than we expect. The length leads to stress, an awkward codebase, a confused team, and often no end in sight. Instead, what if we *prepared* an intentional long term refactor? A few years ago, I began trying this method, and it has led to some surprisingly successful results:
>
> - We didn’t need to negotiate business timelines.
> - We didn’t need to compete against business priorities.
> - The team quickly understood and even took ownership of the refactor over time.
> - There was no increase in stress and risk of burnout.
> - PRs were easy to review, no huge diffs.
> - The refactor was consistently and collaboratively re-evaluated by the entire team.
> - We never wasted time refactoring code that didn’t need it.
> - Our feature development remained unblocked.
> - The team expanded their architectural knowledge.
> - The new engineers had a great source of first tasks.
> - We rolled out the refactor gradually, making it easier to QA, and reducing bugs.

2023-12-28 [Developers experience burnout, but 70% of them code on weekends - ShiftMag](https://shiftmag.dev/developer-lifestye-jetbrains-survey-2189/)

> 2023-12-28 [The State of Developer Ecosystem in 2023 Infographic | JetBrains: Developer Tools for Professionals and Teams](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/)
>
> Almost three-quarters or, more precisely, **73% of developers have experienced burnout,** according to Jet Brains’ report, The State of Developer Ecosystem 2023. The report summarizes insights on developers’ preferred languages and technologies, methodologies, and lifestyles gathered from 26,348 developers from all around the globe.
>
> Another rather unexpected statistic involving three-quarters of developers answers the question of whether they have ever **quit a learning program or a course**. And **75% of respondents said they had.**
>
> The reason? Only a 📌**minority** of developers like learning new tools, technologies, and languages through courses. Instead, they prefer **documentation and APIs ( 67%)** or **blogs and forums (53%)**. When it comes to the type of content they prefer for learning, 53% prefer written content and 45% video. As expected, video content is preferred by respondents aged 21-19.
>
> When asked how much time they spend on learning weekly, 41% of developers said it’s 3 to 8 hours, and 30% of them said it’s one to two hours.

2023-12-01 [Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++ | OpenSSF Best Practices Working Group](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html)

TL;DR: What compiler options should I use?

When compiling C or C++ code on compilers such as GCC and clang, turn on these flags for detecting vulnerabilities at compile time and enable run-time protection mechanisms:

```
-O2 -Wall -Wformat=2 -Wconversion -Wimplicit-fallthrough \
-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 \
-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS \
-fstrict-flex-arrays=3 \
-fstack-clash-protection -fstack-protector-strong \
-Wl,-z,nodlopen -Wl,-z,noexecstack \
-Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now
```

Note that support for some options may differ between different compilers, e.g. support for [`-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE`](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html#-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3) varies depending on the compiler[2](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html#fn:Guelton20) and C standard library implementations. See the discussion below for [background](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html#background) and for [detailed discussion of each option](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html#recommended-compiler-options).

When compiling code in any of the situations in the below table, add the corresponding additional options:

| When                 | Additional options flags                                     |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| using GCC            | `-Wtrampolines`                                              |
| for executables      | `-fPIE -pie`                                                 |
| for shared libraries | `-fPIC -shared`                                              |
| for x86_64           | `-fcf-protection=full`                                       |
| for aarch64          | `-mbranch-protection=standard`                               |
| for production code  | `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks -fno-strict-overflow -fno-strict-aliasing -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero` |

> Creating and maintaining software has a lot more in common with driving than playing chess. There are far more variables involved and the rules are based on judgment calls. You may have a desired outcome when you are building software, but it’s unlikely that it's as singular as chess. Software is rarely done; features get added and bugs are fixed; it’s an ongoing exercise. Unlike software, once a chess game is won or lost it's over.

> Using Function Calling to get a consistent output
> To address the issue of inconsistent output from GPT API, we can utilize function calling in our API requests. Let's consider an example scenario where we want to build a quiz app and generate a list of quiz questions using GPT API. Before function, we would have to ask the model to respond in a certain format, and manually parse the output. By leveraging function calling, we can ensure that the generated output is consistent.
>
> Here's an example code snippet in TypeScript that demonstrates how to achieve this { ... code ...}

```js
// Make the API request with function calling
const res = await openai.createChatCompletion({
  // Use "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613" or "gpt-4-0613" models for function calling
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
  functions,
  // Force the result to be a function call
  function_call: { name: "generateQuiz" },
  messages,
});

// Extract the function arguments from the API response and parse them
const args = res.data.choices[0].message?.function_call?.arguments || "";
const result = JSON.parse(args);
console.log(result);
```
