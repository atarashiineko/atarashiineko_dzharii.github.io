> Imitate, then Innovate is my motto for improving at any skill.
> It’s counterintuitive, but the more we imitate others, the faster we can discover our unique style. In the entertainment world, there’s a long lineage of comedians who tried to copy each other, failed, and became great themselves: Johnny Carson tried to copy Jack Benny, but failed and won six Emmy awards. Then, David Letterman tried to copy Johnny Carson, but failed and became one of America’s great television hosts.

> A security guard works in a building that never gets robbed. He develops a useful heuristic: it he hears a noise, he might as well ignore it and keep on crossing words: it's just the wind. This heuristic is right 99.9% of the time, but it provides literally no value. When all the Brier scores are calculated, he is the best futurist of all. His heuristic is truly superb.

> One of the skills I wish I'd learned earlier in my career is basic Linux server administration. Specifically in relation to hosting something on the web, either a web app or API that I wrote myself, or something from the thriving self-hosted community, such as Wordpress. Managing servers is increasingly seen as the 'older way' of doing things, so it's easy to become a software developer and never learn to set up a VPS, set up remote access, stand up a firewall, etc.

> I have ADHD. It's my superpower. Because brains with ADHD find games hard to resist. And I — an engineer — love building games that make it fun to do unfun things.
> So naturally, as an entrepreneur with full autonomy over my own schedule, I've applied gamification principles to innovate my own work schedule from the ground up rather than lazily adopting norms from the 9-to-5 world.

> In the corner of the student union building there is a coffee shop, and in the corner of the coffee shop are two students. Liz taps away at the keyboard of the battered hand-me-down MacBook her brother gave her when she moved away to college. To her left on the bench seat, Tim scrawls equations on a coil-bound notebook. Between them is a half-empty cup of room temperature coffee that Liz sporadically sips from to stay awake.

- 2022-01-28 [Feature Flags](https://posthog.com/docs/user-guides/feature-flags) Feature Flags allow you to safely deploy and roll back new features. It means you can deploy features and then slowly roll them out to your users. If something has gone wrong, you can roll back new features without having to re-deploy your application. Feature Flags can also help you control access to certain features in your product (e.g. only show paid features to users with an active subscription).

> Gyroflow is an application that can stabilize your video by using motion data from a gyroscope and optionally an accelerometer. Modern cameras record that data internally (GoPro, Sony, Insta360 etc), and this application stabilizes the captured footage precisely by using them. It can also use gyro data from an external source (eg. from Betaflight blackbox). Github: [gyroflow/gyroflow: Video stabilization using gyroscope data](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow)
