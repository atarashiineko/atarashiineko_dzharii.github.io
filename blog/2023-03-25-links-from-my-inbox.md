2023-03-23 [GOTOphobia considered harmful (in C)](https://blog.joren.ga/gotophobia-harmful)

> The main points of this article are:
> - The fear of using the `goto` statement in programming is called "gotophobia" and is usually caused by misunderstanding and lack of context.
> - Dijkstra's "go to statement considered harmful" was written in the 60s when `goto` was the main method of flow control, but now programmers tend to avoid using `goto` even when it's appropriate.
> - Using `goto` over short distances with well-documented labels can be more effective, faster, and cleaner than other constructs.
> - The article presents some situations and patterns where `goto` could be an acceptable choice and discusses `goto`-less alternatives and their potential drawbacks.
