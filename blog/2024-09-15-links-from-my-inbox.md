2024-08-27 [Four Lessons from 2023 That Forever Changes My Software Engineering Career | by Yifeng Liu | Medium | Medium](https://medium.com/@HobokenDays/four-career-lessons-learned-in-2023-that-forever-changed-my-software-engineering-career-52e577b05435) { medium.com }

> This past year, four key lessons transformed my approach to software engineering.
>
> First, I learned that **execution is as important as the idea itself**. Inspired by Steve Jobs, who highlighted the gap between a great idea and a great product, I focused on **rapid prototyping** to test feasibility and **internal presentations** to gather feedback. I kept my manager informed to ensure we were aligned and honest about challenges.
>
> Second, I realized that **trust and credibility are fragile** but crucial. As a senior engineer, I'm expected to lead by solving complex issues and guiding projects. I saw firsthand how failing to execute or pushing unrealistic timelines could quickly erode trust within my team.
>
> The third lesson was about the importance of **visibility**. I understood that hard work could go unnoticed if I didn’t make it visible. I began taking ownership of impactful projects and increased my public presence through presentations and updates. I also honed my **critical thinking** to offer valuable feedback and identify improvement opportunities.
>
> Finally, I learned to **focus on changing myself rather than others**. I used to try to change my team or company, but now I realize it’s more effective to work on my growth and influence others through my actions. Understanding the company’s culture and my colleagues' aspirations helped me align my efforts with my career goals.
>
> These lessons have reshaped my career and how I approach my role as an engineer.

2024-08-28 [Just use fucking paper, man - Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/just-fucking-use-paper-man/) { andy-bell.co.uk }

> 27th of August 2024

> I’ve tried Notion, Obsidian, Things, Apple Reminders, Apple Notes, [Jotter](https://jotter.space/) and endless other tools to keep me organised and sure, Notion has stuck around the most because we use it for client stuff, but for todo lists, all of the above are *way too complicated.*
>
> I’ve given up this week and gone back to paper and a pencil and I feel unbelievably organised and flexible, day-to-day. It’s because it’s **simple**. There’s nothing fancy. No fancy pen or anything like that either. Just a notebook and a pencil.
>
> I’m in an ultra busy period right now so for future me when you inevitably get back to this situation: just. use. fucking. paper.

2024-08-29 [The slow evaporation of the free/open source surplus – Baldur Bjarnason](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/the-slow-evaporation-of-the-foss-surplus/) { www.baldurbjarnason.com }

> I've been thinking a lot about the state of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) lately. My concern is that FOSS thrives on surplus—both from the software industry and the labor of developers. This surplus has been fueled by high margins in the tech industry, easy access to investment, and developers who have the time and financial freedom to contribute to FOSS projects. However, I'm worried that these resources are drying up.
>
> High interest rates are making investments scarcer, particularly for non-AI software, which doesn't really support open-source principles. The post-COVID economic correction is leading to layoffs and higher coder unemployment, which means fewer people have the time or incentive to contribute to FOSS. OSS burnout is another issue, with fewer fresh developers stepping in to replace those who are exhausted by maintaining projects that often lack supportive communities.
>
> Companies are also cutting costs and questioning the value of FOSS. Why invest in open-source projects when the return on investment is uncertain? The rise of LLM-generated code is further disconnecting potential contributors from FOSS projects, weakening the communities that sustain them.
>
> My fear is that FOSS is entering a period of decline. As the industry and labor surpluses shrink, FOSS projects might suffer from neglect, security issues, or even collapse. While some of this decline might be a necessary correction, it's hard not to worry about the future of the FOSS ecosystem, especially when we don't know which parts are sustainable and which are not.

2024-08-31 [Using Fibonacci Numbers to Convert from Miles to Kilometers and Vice Versa](https://catonmat.net/fibonacci-miles-kilometers) { catonmat.net }

> Take two consecutive Fibonacci numbers, for example 5 and 8.
>
> And you're done converting. No kidding – there are 8 kilometers in 5 miles. To convert back just read the result from the other end – there are 5 miles in 8 km!
>
> Another example.
>
> Let's take two consecutive Fibonacci numbers 21 and 34. What this tells us is that there are approximately 34 km in 21 miles and vice versa. (The exact answer is 33.79 km.)

2024-09-11 [The Art of Finishing | ByteDrum](https://www.bytedrum.com/posts/art-of-finishing/) { www.bytedrum.com }

> The article explores the **challenge of unfinished projects** and the cycle of starting with enthusiasm but failing to complete them. The author describes this as the **Hydra Effect**—each task completed leads to new challenges. Unfinished projects feel full of potential, but **fear of imperfection** or even **success** prevents many developers from finishing.
>
> > "An unfinished project is full of intoxicating potential. It could be the next big thing... your magnum opus."
>
> However, leaving projects incomplete creates **mental clutter**, making it hard to focus and learn key lessons like **optimization** and **refactoring**. Finishing is crucial for growth, both technically and professionally.
>
> > "By not finishing, you miss out on these valuable learning experiences."
>
> To break this cycle, the author offers strategies: **define "done" early**, focus on **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product), **time-box** projects, and **separate ideation from implementation**. Practicing small completions and using **accountability** are also recommended to build the habit of finishing.
>
> The article emphasizes that overcoming the Hydra Effect requires **discipline** but leads to personal and professional growth.

2024-09-11 [Improving Application Availability: The Basics | by Mario Bittencourt | SSENSE-TECH | Aug, 2024 | Medium](https://medium.com/ssense-tech/improving-application-availability-the-basics-f6c3365235fc) { medium.com }

> In this article, I introduce the essentials of **application availability** and how to approach **high availability**. High availability is measured by **uptime percentage**. Achieving **99.999%** availability (five nines) means accepting no more than **5 minutes of downtime** per year, which requires **automation** to detect and fix issues fast.
>
> I discuss **redundancy** as a key strategy to improve availability by using backups for **connectivity, compute resources, and persistence**. If one component fails, the system switches to a secondary option. However, redundancy adds both **cost** and **complexity**. More components require advanced tools, like **load balancers**, to manage failures, but these solutions introduce their own reliability concerns.
>
> Not every part of an application needs the same **availability target**. In an **e-commerce** system, for instance, I categorize components into **tiers**: 
>
> - **T1** (website and payments) must stay available at all times.
> - **T2** (order management) allows some downtime.
> - **T3** (fulfillment) can tolerate longer outages.
> - **T4** (ERP) has the least strict requirements.
>
> > "Your goal is to perform an impact analysis and classify each component in tiers according to its criticality and customer impact."
>
> By setting different **availability targets** for each tier, you can reduce costs while focusing on the most important parts of your system.
>
> > "All strategies to improve availability come with trade-offs, usually involving higher costs and complexity."
>
> This sets the stage for future discussions on **graceful degradation**, **asynchronous processing**, and **disaster recovery** strategies.

2024-09-12 [A Bunch of Programming Advice I’d Give To Myself 15 Years Ago Marcus' Blog](https://mbuffett.com/posts/programming-advice-younger-self/) { mbuffett.com }

> If the team is constantly tripping over a recurring issue, it's crucial to **fix the root cause**, rather than repeatedly patching symptoms. The author mentions, "I decided to fix it, and it took ten minutes to update our subscription layer to call subscribers on the main thread instead," thereby removing the cause of crashes, streamlining the codebase, and reducing mental overhead.
>
> **Pace versus quality** must be balanced based on context. In low-risk environments, it's okay to ship faster and rely on guardrails; in high-risk environments (like handling sensitive data), quality takes precedence. "You don’t need 100% test coverage or an extensive QA process, which will slow down the pace of development," when bugs can be fixed easily. 
>
> **Sharpening your tools** is always worth it. Being efficient with your IDE, shortcuts, and dev tools will pay off over time. Fast typing, proficiency in the **shell**, and knowing browser tools matter. Although people warn against over-optimizing configurations, "I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone actually overdo this."
>
> When something is hard to explain, it's likely **incidental complexity**. Often, complexity isn't inherent but arises from the way things are structured. If you can't explain why something is difficult, it’s worth simplifying. The author reflects that "most of the complexity I was explaining was incidental... I could actually address that first."
>
> **Solve bugs at a deeper level**, not just by patching the immediate issue. If a React component crashes due to null `user` data, you could add a conditional return, but it’s better to prevent the state from becoming null in the first place. This creates more **robust systems** and a clearer understanding of how things work.
>
> Investigating bugs should include **reviewing code history**. The author discovered a memory leak after reviewing commits, realizing the issue stemmed from recent code changes. **Git history** can be essential for debugging complex problems that aren't obvious through logs alone. 
>
> Write **bad code** when needed to get feedback. Perfect code takes too long and may not be necessary in every context. It's better to ship something that works, gather feedback, and refine it. "If you err on the side of writing perfect code, you don’t get any feedback."
>
> **Make debugging easier** by building systems that streamline the process. Small conveniences like logging state diffs after every update or restricting staging environment parallelism to 1 can save huge amounts of time. The author stresses, "If it’s over 50%, you should figure out how to make it easier."
>
> Working on a team means **asking questions** when needed. Especially in the first few months, it's faster to ask a coworker for a solution than spending hours figuring it out solo. Asking isn’t seen as a burden, so long as it’s not something trivial that could be self-solved in minutes.
>
> Maintaining a fast **shipping cadence** is critical in startups and time-sensitive projects. Speed compounds over time, and improving systems, reusable patterns, and processes that support fast shipping is essential. "Shipping slowly should merit a post-mortem as much as breaking production does."

2024-09-14 [We need to talk about "founder mode" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDWs3XU3ESo) { www.youtube.com }

> "Stop hiring for the things you don't want to do. Hire for the things you **love** to do so you're forced to deal with the things you don't want to do.
>
> This is some of the best advice I've been giving lately. Early on, I screwed up by hiring an editor because I didn't like editing. Since I didn't love editing, I couldn't be a great workplace for an editor—I couldn't relate to them, and they felt alone. My bar for a good edit was low because I just wanted the work off my plate.
>
> But when I started editing my own stuff, I got pretty good and actually started to like it. Now, I genuinely think I'll stop recording videos before I stop editing them. By doing those things myself, I ended up falling in love with them.
>
> Apply this to startups: If you're a founder who loves coding, hire someone to do it so you can't focus all your time on it. Focus on the other crucial parts of your business that need your attention.
>
> Don't make the mistake of hiring to avoid work. Embrace what you love, and let it force you to grow in areas you might be neglecting."

> **Breaking Through Organizational Barriers: Connect with the Doers, Not Just the Boxes**
>
> In large organizations, it's common to encounter roadblocks where teams are treated as "black boxes" on the org chart. You might hear things like, "We can't proceed because the XYZ team isn't available," or "They need more headcount before tackling this."
>
> Here's a strategy that has made a significant difference for me:
>
> **Start looking beyond the org chart and reach out directly to the individuals who are making things happen.**
>
> **How to find them?**
>
> - **Dive into GitHub or project repositories:** See who's contributing the most code or making significant updates.
> - **Identify the most driven team members:** Every team usually has someone who's more passionate and proactive.
> - **Reach out and build a connection:** They might appreciate a collaborative partner who shares their drive.
>
> **Why do this?**
>
> - **Accelerate Progress:** Bypass bureaucratic delays and get projects moving.
> - **Build Valuable Relationships:** These connections can lead to future opportunities, referrals, or even partnerships.
> - **Expand Your Influence:** Demonstrating initiative can set you apart and open doors within the organization.
>
> **Yes, there are risks.** Your manager might question why you're reaching out independently, or you might face resistance. But consider the potential rewards:
>
> - **Best Case:** You successfully collaborate to solve problems, driving innovation and making a real impact.
> - **Worst Case:** Even if you face pushback, you've connected with someone valuable. If either of you moves on, that relationship could lead to exciting opportunities down the line.

2024-09-15 [Why Scrum is Stressing You Out - by Adam Ard](https://rethinkingsoftware.substack.com/p/why-scrum-is-stressing-you-out) { rethinkingsoftware.substack.com }

> 📌 Sprints never stop. Sprints in **Scrum** are constant, unlike the traditional **Waterfall** model where high-pressure periods are followed by low-pressure times. Sprints create ongoing, medium-level **stress**, which is more damaging long-term than short-term, intense stress. Long-term stress harms both **mental** and **physical health**.
> **Advice**: Build in deliberate **breaks** between sprints. Allow teams time to recover, reflect, and recalibrate before the next sprint. Introduce **buffer periods** for less intense work or creative activities.
>
> 🔖 Sprints are **involuntary**. Sprints in a Scrum environment are often imposed on developers, leaving them no control over the **process** or duration. Lack of **autonomy** leads to higher stress, similar to studies where forced activity triggers stress responses in animals. Control over work processes can reduce stress and improve **job satisfaction**.
> **Advice**: Involve the team in the **sprint planning** process and give them a say in determining task durations, sprint length, and workload. Increase **autonomy** to reduce stress by tailoring the Scrum process to fit the team’s needs rather than rigidly following preset rules.
>
> 😡 Sprints neglect key supporting activities. Scrum focuses on completing tasks within sprint cycles but doesn’t allocate enough time for essential **preparatory activities** like brainstorming and research. The lack of **preparation time** creates stress and leads to suboptimal work because **thinking** and **doing** cannot be entirely separated.
> **Advice**: Allocate time within sprints for essential **preparation**, brainstorming, and research. Set aside dedicated periods for planning, learning, or **technical exploration**, rather than expecting full-time execution during the sprint.
>
> 🍷 Most Scrum implementations devolve into **“Scrumfall.”** Scrum is often mixed with **Waterfall-like** big-deadline pressures, which cancel out the benefits of sprints and increase stress. When major **deadlines** approach, Scrum practices are suspended, leading to a high-stress environment combining the worst aspects of both methodologies.
> **Advice**: Resist combining Waterfall-style big **deadlines** with Scrum. Manage **stakeholder expectations** upfront and break larger goals into smaller deliverables aligned with sprint cycles. Stick to **Agile principles** and avoid falling back into the big-bang, all-at-once delivery mode.

> The MrBeast definition of A, B and C-team players is one I haven’t heard before:
>
> > A-Players are obsessive, learn from mistakes, coachable, intelligent, don’t make excuses, believe in Youtube, see the value of this company, and are the best in the goddamn world at their job. B-Players are new people that need to be trained into A-Players, and C-Players are just average employees. […] They arn’t obsessive and learning. C-Players are poisonous and should be transitioned to a different company IMMEDIATELY. (It’s okay we give everyone severance, they’ll be fine).
