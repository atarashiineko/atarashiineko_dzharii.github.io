> Working for a famous tech company, I get asked a lot "Why don't you use technology X?" X may be an application, programming language, operating system, hypervisor, processor, or tool. It may be because:
> It performs poorly.
> It is too expensive.
> It is not open source.

- 2022-03-26 [What made the NES so interesting?](https://nicole.express/2022/the-nes-as-an-artifact.html)
> I often like to cover oddities here; details of computers and arcade systems people may not have heard of, that didn’t sell well but had unique or interesting characteristics. But focusing on oddities like that can disguise the fact that sometimes, even systems that were very popular can stand out for unique design. Such be it with the Nintendo Entertainment System: had Nintendo’s console flopped, it’d definitely have a post already. But it doesn’t. Let’s fix that! And answer a simple question I was asked: what’s the deal with special chip games?

> In February, I wrote about getting rid of my iPhone and replacing it with a Nokia 6300 4G. I am incredibly happy with the results of this experience. I gained a new sense of presence with the real world and killed some bad scrolling habits. Unfortunately, KaiOS on the Nokia left much to be desired and our current society makes it very difficult to live without a smart phone.

> Windows is such a mess! It’s sort of shocking how much of a mess it is. Desktop Linux is often criticized for this, but Windows is much worse, somehow! It’s really inconsistent. Half of it is “new” UI and half of it is old Win32/GDI type UI - just as bad

> Best Current Practises:
>
> 1. Authors MUST NOT implement bugs.
> 2. If bugs are introduced in code, they MUST be clearly documented.
> 3. When implementing specifications that are broken by design, it is
>       RECOMMENDED to aggregate multiple smaller bugs into one larger
>       bug.  This will be easier to document: rather than having a lot
>       of hard-to-track inconsequential bugs, there will be only a few
>       easy-to-recognise significant bugs.
> 4. The aphorism "It's not a bug, it's a feature" is considered rude.
> 5. Assume all external input is the result of (a series of) bugs.
>     (Especially in machine-to-machine applications such as
>     implementations of network protocols.)
> 6. In fact, assume all internal inputs also are the result of bugs.

> This guide is meant to document the things I have done, the software I have used, and the decisions I have made to be really fast and really well-organized at work, and to help prioritize and maintain focus on my current activities. One key decision, made for speed above all else, is to capture as much of my thinking and work in plaintext as I can. Thus the name: Plaintext Productivity. I will explain my reasoning behind choosing plaintext in each section in which it is relevant.

So here's how I built it, and how you can build your own too. It's a great weekend project, and I learned a lot from finishing it.

> What if we introduce an explicit type for PII, like `PiiString`. The idea is to have `PiiString` type as much interchangeable with String as possible to simplify refactoring existing code which uses the String. Then, within the application boundary it should behave like usual String, however crossing application boundaries it should be encoded/encrypted/hashed.
