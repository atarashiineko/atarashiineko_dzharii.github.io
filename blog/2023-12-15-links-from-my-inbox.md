> A wide, atmospheric, and realistic 3D rendered image of a decrepit room in a Silent Hill setting, featuring an old, bulky CRT computer. The computer sits on a heavy, worn wooden desk, the screen flickering with static and displaying cryptic, glitched messages that seem to come from another world. The walls of the room are peeling and stained, and the only light comes from the eerie, unnatural glow of the computer screen, which casts long, sinister shadows. Cobwebs stretch from the corners of the room to the ancient machine, and the air is thick with the smell of mold and electronic burning. The atmosphere is dense with a sense of abandonment and horror, with every detail from the dusty keyboard to the murky, cracked window contributing to the chilling scene.

2023-08-15 Book 🚩 [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/toc.html)

>We’ve found that expertise and shared communication forums offer great value as an organization scales.  As engineers discuss and answer questions in shared forums, knowledge tends to spread. New experts grow. If you have a hundred engineers writing Java, a single friendly and helpful Java expert willing to answer questions will soon produce a hundred engineers writing better Java code. Knowledge is viral, experts are carriers, and there’s a lot to be said for the value of clearing away the common stumbling blocks for your engineers.

2023-12-18 🥕 [What it takes to be a Senior IC at Meta | by Analytics at Meta | Dec, 2023 | Medium](https://medium.com/@AnalyticsAtMeta/being-a-senior-ic-59ee705ba3c1)

> There are some common traps people and teams can run into.
>
> - Expecting ICs to generate projects out of thin air. It might sound appealing at first — *I can work on anything, the biggest ideas*! But it’s usually unnecessarily difficult, and less likely to hit the sweet spot of topics and timing when not anchored in existing critical needs. For managers, this means starting with a rough role scope and top problems in mind, rather than starting with a generic senior IC and hoping they’ll figure out something great to do.
> - Managers leaving senior IC roles out of organizational planning. Ideally, org plans include senior IC roles: Where are they most needed? How do they fit into the org’s leadership team? Is the intention to grow existing ICs into them vs. bring new senior ICs in? Being explicit about these helps ICs understand needs and opportunities for themselves.
> - ICs fearing failure, or failing slowly. Senior roles come with a necessary risk of failure. It can be tempting to avoid or minimize that risk altogether — only taking on what’s simpler or certain — but that comes with opportunity costs. On the other hand, trying too long on a failed approach isn’t good either. Ways to address these include timeboxing big bet projects, breaking large projects into milestones, recognizing “good failures,” debriefing on failures (and successes!), and developing a culture that supports healthy risks.

2023-12-08 [Goodbye, Clean Code — overreacted](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/)

> Clean code is not an objective metric, but a subjective preference that can vary depending on the context and the goals of the project.
> Removing duplication and creating abstractions can have unintended consequences, such as making the code more rigid, complex, and difficult to understand and change.
> Coding is a journey of learning and discovery, and developers should be open to different perspectives and approaches, and not be dogmatic or judgmental about code quality1

> I struggle with staying productive and organizing myself. I am a chronic procrastinator and have tried everything to be more productive like lists, calendars, apps, etc. but I still can't seem to get things done. I want to study more, read more, and finish my coding projects. However, I end up not doing much and feel terribly guilty. I suspect I may have ADHD or some kind of dopamine addiction but I'm not sure. I do well in school even by studying at the last minute, and I attend a rather challenging school. In my free time though, I end up doing very little or nothing, not knowing where my time went. I try to remove all distractions but it doesn't seem to work.
