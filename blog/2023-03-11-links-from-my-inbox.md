> The Rules
>
> - "Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have."
> - "Never go outside the expertise of your people."
> - "Whenever possible go outside the expertise of the enemy."
> - "Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules."
> - "Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. There is no defense. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage."
> - "A good tactic is one your people enjoy."
> - "A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag."
> - "Keep the pressure on."
> - "The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself. "
> - "The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition."
> - "If you push a negative hard and deep enough it will break through into its counterside; this is based on the principle that every positive has its negative."
> - "The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative."
> - "Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. "

## Azure

> a tutorial on how to use Azure Functions to process real-time data from Azure Event Hubs and persist it to Azure Cosmos DB. It demonstrates how to combine a real-time data ingestion component with a Serverless processing layer using a sample app.

> If you want to ingest data from Event Hub to Cosmos DB, one possible solution is to use Azure Functions with an Event Hub trigger and a Cosmos DB output binding. This way, you can process real-time data from Event Hubs and persist it to Cosmos DB123.
>
> To implement this solution, you need to:
>
> Create an Event Hub namespace and an event hub
>
> Create a Cosmos DB account, database and container
>
> Create a Function App with an Event Hub trigger function
>
> Configure the function settings with the connection strings for Event Hubs and Cosmos DB
>
> Add a Cosmos DB output binding annotation to your function code
>
> Write your function logic to process the event data and return a document object for Cosmos DB

  > This is a list of questions which may be interesting to a tech job applicant. The points are not ordered and many may not apply to a given position or work type. It was started as my personal list of questions, which grew over time to include both things I'd like to see more of and red flags which I'd like to avoid. I've also noticed how few questions were asked by people I interviewed and I think those were missed opportunities.
