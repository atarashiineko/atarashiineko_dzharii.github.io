2024-12-28 [Developer with ADHD? You’re not alone. - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/26/developer-with-adhd-youre-not-alone/) {stackoverflow.blog}

> **Reddit:** 2024-12-28 [Got ADHD? Program computers? Even close with either? Talk about it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/) {www.reddit.com}
>
> Many developers with ADHD feel their job is a perfect fit for how they think and approach problems. “Coding can give ADHD brains exactly the kind of stimulation they crave,” [explains](https://dev.to/abbeyperini/coding-and-adhd-adhd-brains-im1) full-stack developer Abbey Perini. “Not only is coding a creative endeavor that involves constantly learning new things, but also once one problem is solved, there’s always a brand new one to try.”
>
> In addition to a revolving door of fresh challenges that can keep people with ADHD engaged, coding can reward and encourage a state of [hyperfocus](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/hyperfocus-and-adhd/): a frequently cited symptom of ADHD that developer [Neil Peterson](https://adapthd.com/topics/coping-strategies/programming-with-adhd-the-good-the-bad-and-the-hyperfocus/) calls “a state of laser-like concentration in which distractions and even a sense of passing time seem to fade away.”

> **The hidden cost of "AI Speed"**: When you watch a senior engineer work with AI tools like Cursor or Copilot, it looks like magic. They can scaffold entire features in minutes, complete with tests and documentation. But watch carefully, and you'll notice something crucial: They're not just accepting what the AI suggests. They're constantly:
>
> - Refactoring the generated code into smaller, focused modules
> - Adding edge case handling the AI missed
> - Strengthening type definitions and interfaces
> - Questioning architectural decisions
> - Adding comprehensive error handling
>
> In other words, they're applying years of hard-won engineering wisdom to shape and constrain the AI's output. The AI is accelerating their implementation, but their expertise is what keeps the code maintainable.
>
> **The knowledge paradox:** Here's the most counterintuitive thing I've discovered: AI tools help experienced developers more than beginners. This seems backward – shouldn't AI democratize coding?
>
> The reality is that AI is like having a very eager junior developer on your team. They can write code quickly, but they need constant supervision and correction. The more you know, the better you can guide them.
>
> **This creates what I call the "knowledge paradox":**
>
> - Seniors use AI to accelerate what they already know how to do
> - Juniors try to use AI to learn what to do
> - The results differ dramatically
>
> **I've watched senior engineers use AI to:**
>
> - Rapidly prototype ideas they already understand
> - Generate basic implementations they can then refine
> - Explore alternative approaches to known problems
> - Automate routine coding tasks
>
> **Meanwhile, juniors often:**
>
> - Accept incorrect or outdated solutions
> - Miss critical security and performance considerations
> - Struggle to debug AI-generated code
> - Build fragile systems they don't fully understand

>
> **Take Ownership of Your Career**
> No one is responsible for your career growth but you. While managers may offer guidance, the responsibility to seek opportunities, take initiative, and drive your own development is yours alone. Waiting for someone else to guide your progression will leave you stagnant.
>
> > "No one is responsible for your career path but you."
>
> **Seek Mentorship — It’s a Shortcut to Mastery**
> A mentor can accelerate your growth by giving you insights, sharing their decision-making process, and exposing you to higher-level thinking. Actively seek out senior engineers, build relationships, and ask questions. This can be one of the most effective ways to "level up" faster than self-learning alone.
>
> > "Having a mentor is a force multiplier! It’s literally a means to learn faster, it’s a shortcut!"
>
> **Initiative is Always Rewarded**
> No employer will think less of you for taking initiative. If something is blocked, find a way around it. Push for better solutions, offer new ideas, and take on challenges without being asked. This attitude of "full ownership" sets you apart. Engineers who "unblock themselves" — even by learning disciplines outside their core expertise — become the most valuable contributors.
>
> > "Nothing is more important than making your colleagues feel comfortable and safe working with you."
>
> **The Dunning-Kruger Effect is Real — Be Humble and Self-Aware**
> At some point, you will overestimate your own skills. Recognizing this gap is essential for growth. Take feedback seriously, reflect on your mistakes, and focus on learning through deliberate practice. Switch from "just get it done" to "learn all you need to do it right." This mindset shift will elevate your skill set.
>
> **Master the "Glue Work" That Holds Teams Together**
> It’s not enough to just write code. The ability to **coordinate, track, and organize work** is a rare and valuable skill. Acting as the "glue" between people, projects, and teams will make you indispensable. Track tickets, follow up on blockers, and ensure no one is left behind. Great engineers don’t just "code" — they also **lead, unblock, and delegate**.
>
> **Technical Excellence is Necessary, But Not Sufficient**
> You can be a great coder, but without skills like **communication, empathy, and coordination**, you won’t become a senior engineer. Learn to **bridge the gap between engineers, product managers, and customers**. Senior engineers know how to translate customer requirements into engineering solutions and help their teams grow.
>
> **Learn to See the Business, Not Just the Code**
> As you grow in your career, it’s not just about building "good" software — it’s about building software that drives **business outcomes**. Learn to ask, "How will this impact our KPIs?" and prioritize cost-efficient, high-impact solutions. This business-first mindset can distinguish you as a senior engineer and lead to better decision-making.
>
> > "At one point, we scratched the 'optimal solution' for a good enough, 10x cheaper solution. Engineering is all about tradeoffs."
>
> **Resilience and Observability Are Non-Negotiable Skills**
> Handling production incidents teaches you to value **system reliability, observability, and DevOps**. As you progress, mastering **monitoring, alerting, and on-call response** will become essential. Developers who "speak infrastructure" become highly valuable, as they can ensure stability and avoid system failure.
>
> > "It became clear that being a developer that 'speaks' and understands infrastructure is a superpower, and a differentiating factor."
>
> **Continuous Learning is Not Optional**
> The craft of software engineering evolves rapidly. Relying on daily work alone will not keep you at the top. You need to invest in side learning — read books like *Clean Code* and *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, attend meetups, seek mentorship, and watch technical talks. Growth requires time and passion outside daily tasks.
>
> > "Learning through daily tasks is not enough for becoming a top-tier engineer. The craft and technology are just too complex and require a lot of passion and time."
>
> **Be a Decent Human Being — It Matters More Than You Think**
> Nothing beats being a kind, respectful, and empathetic teammate. People remember how you make them feel. Psychological safety and trust are essential for high-performing teams. As you grow into senior roles, prioritize creating safe, welcoming environments where people can speak up, share ideas, and fail without fear of judgment.
>
> > "Nothing — and I mean it — Nothing! is more important than being a decent human being, a pleasant colleague, and a pragmatic engineer."

2024-12-15 [Preferring throwaway code over design docs](https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2024/12/14/throwaway-prs-not-design-docs) { softwaredoug.com }

>
> Another important point is on using PRs for documentation. They are one of the best forms of documentation for devs. They’re discoverable - one of the first places you look when trying to understand why code is implemented a certain way. PRs don’t profess to reflect the current state of the world, but a state at a point in time. A historical artifact. On the other hand, most design docs lie to you. They’re [undead documentation](https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2023/10/13/fight-undead-documentation). Unless you’re fastidious of keeping them up to date (most of us aren’t) they reflect an outdated view of reality.

2024-12-11 [From where I left - antirez](https://antirez.com/news/144) { antirez.com }

> The blog post by **Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez)** reflects on his journey with **Redis**, his departure, and his decision to return. He also shares insights into Redis's past, his thoughts on software licensing, and new technical concepts he's working on, such as vector sets for Redis. Below is a detailed digest of the key points from the article.
>
> After leaving Redis about 4.4 years ago, Salvatore detached himself from the project's code, commits, and technical management. This detachment was not born out of resentment but rather a desire to explore other areas like **writing and embedded projects**, while also spending more time with family. He describes this period as a time to "hack randomly" and explore areas like **neural networks** and **Telegram bots**. However, this "random hacking" eventually left him feeling a lack of purpose, which reignited his desire to **return to the tech world**.
>
> > "Hacking randomly was cool but, in the long run, my feeling was that I was lacking a real purpose, and every day I started to feel a bigger urgency to be part of the tech world again."
>
> Salvatore's return to Redis began during a trip to **New York City** with his 12-year-old daughter. Reflecting on life changes and purpose, he decided to re-engage with Redis. This led to a conversation with the new Redis CEO, **Rowan Trollope**, where they discussed Salvatore's possible role. He proposed becoming a bridge between Redis Labs and the **Redis community**, creating educational materials like **demos, tutorials, and new design concepts**. An agreement was quickly reached, allowing him to rejoin Redis in a **part-time role**.
>
> > "I wrote him an email saying: do you think I could be back in some kind of capacity? Rowan showed interest in my proposal, and quickly we found some agreement."

2024-12-10 [What TDD is ACTUALLY Good For – Axol's Blog](https://theaxolot.wordpress.com/2024/12/08/what-tdd-is-actually-good-for/) { theaxolot.wordpress.com }

> In an [earlier article](https://theaxolot.wordpress.com/2024/08/09/its-your-fault-people-dont-like-tdd/), I tore through some terrible arguments used to advocate for TDD that I see all too often (even by experienced engineers). I said in that piece that I would eventually go through what I think are better arguments for TDD, so that’s what I’m gonna do now.

> **Brownfield** work also lends itself well to TDD, but less so. It depends on the complexity of the new feature, and the extendibility of the codebase. You have to use your best judgment. If it seems like a feature requires significant changes to existing modules, I’d lean on traditional development. However, if you see a gentle path to implementing this new feature, you might reap more benefits with TDD.
>
> **Greenfield** development is a big no-no for TDD (at first). I don’t care how confident you are in what your interfaces will be. **You’re not that good**. Everything you think you know will change in the exploratory phase of a new project as you code, and you’ll strain your sanity by rewriting tests over and over again. Don’t do this, no matter how much your TDD idol pontificates its benefits.

> es, this is what everybody I know is experiencing right now.
>
> Caveat lector: This is simply a retelling of my personal experience, YMMV. This is not advice.
>
> What has consistently worked for me: I stopped applying for jobs, and redirected all that effort into creating and publishing open source projects that demonstrate competence in the areas of work I want. And, just as importantly, I contribute to big established open source projects in those areas too.
>
> I did not apply for my current job (started 6 months ago): they solicited me, based on my open source work. All the best jobs I've had have been like that, this is the 3rd time it worked.
>
> When I'm unemployed, I only apply for jobs I actually want, typically spending an hour each on 0-2 extremely targeted applications per week. But I treat churning out new open source stuff as my full time job until somebody notices. In addition to successfully landing me three great jobs over the past decade, this approach has made me a much much better programmer.
>
> Also, I strongly believe spending hours a day writing new code will enhance your ability to pass technical interviews much more than gamified garbage like leetcode.
>
> A huge part of making this work is not living a typical valley lifestyle: I plan my life around the median national salary for a software engineer, and when I'm making more than that it all goes straight into my savings. In the bay, that requires living frugally (by bay standards...), but I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am to past-decade-me for living like that and giving today-me the freedom to turn down the bad jobs and wait for the good ones. Obviously, I don't have children.
>
> I do a lot more open source than a typical programmer in the valley, but I don't think I'm "exceptional" in any sense: you just have to put in the work. I do feel like I was very lucky to start my career in an extremely open-source-centric role, and in fairness that gives me a leg up here which I am probably inclined to underestimate.

2024-12-05 [How to Grow Professional Relationships | Tejas Kumar](https://tej.as/blog/how-to-grow-professional-relationships-tjs-model) { tej.as }

> In my career, I’ve worked with some extraordinary people while also encountering the barriers of exclusionary cliques and gatekeeping. These experiences prompted me to examine how professional relationships develop, leading to the creation of the **TJS (The Journey to Synergy) Collaboration Model**. This framework identifies seven stages that relationships can pass through, from competitive isolation to productive collaboration.
>
> For those striving to build stronger, more impactful connections—whether in business, creative endeavors, or personal growth—this model offers a clear lens to understand where you stand and how to move forward.
>
> ![image-20241204195601197](./2024-12-29-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241204195601197.png)
>
> **The 7 Stages of the TJS Collaboration Model: A Quick Digest**
>
> 1. **Everything is a Competition**
>    Relationships are marked by exclusion and a zero-sum mindset. Gatekeeping and discrimination dominate, with little to no collaboration or shared goals.
> 2. **Coexist**
>    Acknowledgment of each other's existence without meaningful interaction. There’s mutual respect but little effort to engage, often due to differing goals, values, or personalities.
> 3. **Communicate**
>    Basic exchange of information occurs, but interactions remain shallow. Conversations may begin, but follow-through and deeper engagement are often lacking.
> 4. **Cooperate**
>    Parties work together on neutral, low-stakes tasks with transactional motives. Cooperation may lead to future opportunities but doesn’t yet involve deep trust or shared investment.
> 5. **Coordinate**
>    One party adopts the other’s goal and takes deliberate steps to align efforts. Trust begins to form as actions are coordinated for mutual benefit, laying the groundwork for deeper collaboration.
> 6. **Collaborate**
>    A shared project is created together, with both parties contributing equally and meaningfully. Trust, understanding, and synergy define this stage, as both sides grow from the partnership.
> 7. **We Are the Same**
>    A toxic state where boundaries dissolve, leading to unhealthy co-dependence. Individuality is lost, and relationships suffer from over-enmeshment and burnout.

> When modeling a Postgres database, you probably don’t give much thought to the order of columns in your tables. After all, it seems like the kind of thing that wouldn’t affect storage or performance. But what if I told you that simply reordering your columns could reduce the size of your tables and indexes by 20%? This isn’t some obscure database trick — it’s a direct result of how Postgres aligns data on disk.
>
> In this post, I’ll explore how column alignment works in Postgres, why it matters, and how you can optimize your tables for better efficiency. Through a few real-world examples, you’ll see how even small changes in column order can lead to measurable improvements.

> You know those moments when your code feels sluggish, and you wonder if there’s a better way? Sometimes, there is. [Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me/blog/) recently shared a cool story about swapping a Python script for a custom C++ utility and saving their company a ton of cash. The gist? Their Python script, used to process a JSON file every few seconds, was hogging a full CPU core. They reworked it into a C++ program using some smart libraries like simdjson, and the difference was night and day: over ten times faster, turning a snail into a lightning bolt.
>
> Python is great for getting things up and running quickly, but when performance really matters—like shaving off milliseconds in a process that runs all day—C++ can be a game changer. It takes more effort to write, sure, but the payoff in speed and efficiency can be huge. Of course, it’s not all rainbows; setting up dependencies and dealing with compilation takes extra time. But tools like CMake and CPM are making that part a lot less painful these days.
>
> Python’s convenience makes it perfect for many tasks, but when you’re pushing the limits of performance, don’t be afraid to roll up your sleeves and dive into C++. It’s a little extra work upfront, but when the results are this good, it’s worth it. Plus, you might even impress your team with how much you can squeeze out of your hardware. Sometimes, the old-school tools are still the best ones for the job.

> Python comes with a lot of bundled functionality whereas C++ requires you to give more thought to dependencies. Thankfully CMake with CPM make recovering the dependencies painless:

```cmake
include(cmake/CPM.cmake)
CPMAddPackage("gh:fmtlib/fmt#11.0.2")
CPMAddPackage("gh:simdjson/simdjson@3.10.1")
CPMAddPackage("gh:fastfloat/fast_float@6.1.6")

First, we look at what kind of data is most naturally phrased as a graph, and some common examples. Second, we explore what makes graphs different from other types of data, and some of the specialized choices we have to make when using graphs. Third, we build a modern GNN, walking through each of the parts of the model, starting with historic modeling innovations in the field. We move gradually from a bare-bones implementation to a state-of-the-art GNN model. Fourth and finally, we provide a GNN playground where you can play around with a real-word task and dataset to build a stronger intuition of how each component of a GNN model contributes to the predictions it makes.

However, it is important to note that ARC-AGI is not an acid test for AGI – as we've repeated dozens of times this year.

> Data quality emerged as the second most significant hurdle. “80 percent of AI is the dirty work of data engineering,” an interviewee stated. “You need good people doing the dirty work—otherwise their mistakes poison the algorithms.”

> WonderWorld allows real-time rendering and fast scene generation. This allows a user to navigate existing scenes, and specify where and what to generate a new scene. Here are examples where a user specifies scene contents (via text) and locations (via camera movement) to create a virtual world. Videos here are accelerated.

> I'm increasingly building entire functional prototypes from start to finish using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It's an amazing productivity boost. Here are a few recent examples:
>
> - **[Image Resize Quality Tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/image-resize-quality)**: This is a tool for dropping in an image and instantly seeing resized versions of that image at different JPEG qualities, each of which can be downloaded. I used to use the (much better) [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) for this, but my cut-down version is optimized for my workflow (picking the smallest JPEG version that remains legible). Notes and prompts on how I built it are available [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/26/image-resize-and-quality-comparison/).
>
> - **[django-http-debug](https://github.com/simonw/django-http-debug)**: This is an actual open-source Python package I released that was mostly written for me by Claude. It's a webhooks debugger where you can set up a URL, and it will log all incoming requests to a database table for you. Notes on how I built it are available [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/8/django-http-debug/).
>
> - **datasette-checkbox**: This is a Datasette plugin that adds toggle checkboxes to any table with `is_` or `has_` columns. An animated demo and prompts showing how I built the initial prototype can be found [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/16/datasette-checkbox/).
>
> - **[Gemini BBox Tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox)**: This is a tool for trying out Gemini 1.5 Pro's ability to return bounding boxes for items it identifies. You'll need a Gemini API key for this one, or you can check out the demo and notes [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/26/gemini-bounding-box-visualization/).
>
> - **[Gemini Chat Tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-chat)**: This is a similar tool for trying out different Gemini models (Google released three more yesterday) with a streaming chat interface. Notes on how I built it are available [here](https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-chat).

> I still see some people arguing that LLM-assisted development like this is a waste of time, and they spend more effort correcting mistakes in the code than if they had written it from scratch themselves.
>
> I couldn't disagree more. My development process has always started with prototypes, and the speed at which I can get a proof-of-concept prototype up and running with these tools is quite frankly absurd.
