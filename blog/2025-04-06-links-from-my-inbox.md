> Code review often feels like a minefield, sparking friction and conflict. But there’s a better way. Instead of rigid comments through software, engage in real-time, face-to-face discussions. This human touch helps diffuse tension and builds trust. Imagine a dynamic duo: one writes code while the other offers instant feedback, cutting down misunderstandings.
>
> When reviewing textually, be mindful. Don’t nitpick style. Instead, frame comments to add value. Questions and suggestions work better than criticisms. Highlight what’s right, too; positive reinforcement matters. If you’re feeling hurt by feedback, remember that it’s often well-intentioned. Moving past ego, and embracing constructive dialogue, leads to superior code and stronger relationships. 
>
> Mastering this art isn’t just about writing better code; it’s about **being the teammate you’d want to work with**. Understanding people and relationships is key. With kindness, respect, and genuine collaboration, you can transform code review from a dreaded chore into a meaningful, productive experience.
>
> A good way to think about code review is as a process of *adding value* to existing code. So any comment you plan to make had better do exactly that. Here are a few ways to phrase and frame the different kinds of reactions you may have when reviewing someone else’s code:
>
> - *Not my style*. Everyone has their own style: their particular favourite way of naming things, arranging things, and expressing them syntactically. If you didn’t write this code, it won’t be in your style, but that’s okay. You don’t need to comment about that; changing the code to match your style wouldn’t add value to it. Just leave it be.
> - *Don’t understand what this does*. If you’re not sure what the code actually says, that’s *your* problem. If you don’t know what a particular piece of language syntax means, or what a certain function does, look it up. The author is trying to get their work done, not teach you how to program.
> - *Don’t understand why it does that*. On the other hand, if you can’t work out *why* the code says what it says, you can ask a question: “I’m not quite clear what the intent of this is. Is there something I’m not seeing?” Usually there is, so ask for clarification rather than flagging it as “wrong”.
> - *Could be better*. If the code is basically okay, but you think there’s a better way to write it that’s not just a style issue, turn your suggestion into a question. “Would it be clearer to write…? Do you think X is a more logical name for…? Would it be faster to re-use this variable, or doesn’t that matter here?”
> - *Something to consider*. Sometimes you have an idea that *might* be helpful, but you’re not sure. Maybe the author already thought of that idea and rejected it, or maybe they just didn’t think of it. But your comment could easily be interpreted as criticism, so make it tentative and gentle: “It occurred to me that it might be a slight improvement to use a `sync.Pool` here, but maybe that’s just overkill. What do you think?”
> - *Don’t think this is right*. If it seems to you like the code is incorrect, or shouldn’t be there, or there’s some code missing that *should* be there, again, make it a question, not a rebuke. “Wouldn’t we normally want to check this error? Is there some reason why it’s not necessary here?” If you’re wrong, you’ve left yourself a graceful way to retreat. If you’re right, you’ve tactfully made a point without making an enemy.
> - *Missed something out*. The code is fine as far as it goes, but there are cases the author hasn’t considered, or some important issues they’re overlooking. Use the “yes, and…” technique: “This looks great for the normal case, but I wonder what would happen if this input were really large, for example? Would it be a good idea to…?”
> - *This is definitely wrong*. The author has just made a slip, or there’s something you know that they don’t know. This is your opportunity to enlighten them, with all due kindness and humility. Don’t just rattle off what’s wrong; take the time to phrase your response carefully, gracefully. Again, use questions and suggestions. “It looks like we log the error here, but continue anyway. Is it really safe to do that, if the result is `nil`? What do you think about returning the error here instead?”

> The ten rules of negotiating
>
> I’ve tried to boil down negotiation to ten rules. The rules, in order of appearance, are:
>
> 1. Get everything in writing
> 2. Always keep the door open
> 3. Information is power
> 4. Always be positive
> 5. Don’t be the decision maker
> 6. Have alternatives
> 7. Proclaim reasons for everything
> 8. Be motivated by more than just money
> 9. Understand what they value
> 10. Be winnable
>
> We’ll only get through some of these in this blog post, and the rest will appear in the second part. But I’ll explain each rule as we get to it.
>
> So let’s start from the top and try to walk through a negotiation process from the very beginning. For most, that starts when you receive an offer.

> - **Managers are paid to drive results with some support**. They have experience in the function, can take responsibility, but are still learning the job and will have questions and need support. They can execute the tactical plan for a project but typically can’t make it.
>
> - **Directors are paid to drive results with little or no supervision** (“set and forget”). Directors know how to do the job. They can make a project’s tactical plan in their sleep. They can work across the organization to get it done. I love strong directors. They get shit done.

> We’re living in a world where billion dollar tech companies expect us to live and breathe code, demanding 80 hour weeks under the guise of "passion." And what do we get in return? Burnout, anxiety, and the constant threat of layoffs. It’s time to face facts: this industry is not your friend. It’s a machine, and unless we start organizing, it’s going to keep grinding us down. It’s time to talk about unionizing tech jobs.

2025-03-18 [Breaking Up with On-Call ·](https://reflector.dev/articles/breaking-up-with-on-call/) { reflector.dev }

> `on-call`, `startups`, `big-tech`, `AI`, `culture`
>
> ![image-20250317212232460](2025-04-06-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20250317212232460.png)
>
> On-call responsibilities in big tech have grown into a culture of reactive firefighting, where engineers babysit unreliable systems instead of improving their robustness. In startups, limited resources create similar roles, but with a focus on direct problem-solving. Big companies, however, normalize and entrench on-call practices, rewarding band-aid solutions over systemic fixes, leading to declining software quality.
>
> The incentives in big tech favor quick feature delivery and measurable outcomes over long-term maintenance and ownership. Engineers cycle through projects without fully addressing technical debt, while management prioritizes metrics that showcase immediate progress. This creates a loop of short-term fixes and neglect of robust design, resulting in on-call roles that never end.
>
> AI has potential to reshape on-call by automating mundane tasks like finding related issues or allocating responsibilities. Properly integrated, AI tools can help engineers focus on meaningful work by reducing repetitive efforts. However, a cultural shift is necessary to make on-call the exception, not the norm, fostering better engineering practices and happier teams.

2025-03-10 ["You need to be more strategic" — a primer on strategy for software engineers | Writing by Dan Pupius](https://writing.pupius.co.uk/you-need-to-be-more-strategic-dc473a2aa319) { writing.pupius.co.uk }

>`strategy`, `softwareengineering`, `decisionmaking`, `frameworks`, `leadership`
>
>Being **more strategic** as a software engineer isn't about long-term planning or big decisions; it's about creating a framework that guides daily decision-making. Strategy defines a path forward and clarifies trade-offs—what to prioritize and what to avoid—to align with core objectives. For example, improving system reliability might involve focusing on end-to-end automated tests rather than slowing down releases. A good strategy shapes decisions and narrows options, providing clarity on what actions to take.
>
>Three useful frameworks can help in thinking strategically. Rumelt's Kernel breaks strategy into diagnosis (identifying the core challenge), guiding policy (deciding the approach), and coherent actions (steps aligning with the policy). The "Playing to Win" framework asks five critical questions about aspirations, focus areas, unique approaches, necessary capabilities, and management systems. This helps clarify priorities and connect technical work to business goals. McKinsey's Three Horizons framework helps balance immediate needs with long-term goals, encouraging work across short-term optimization, emerging opportunities, and future capabilities.
>
>Being strategic means creating systems for how decisions are made, not just making decisions. These frameworks help diagnose problems, define winning strategies, and balance immediate and future needs. However, even great strategies require solid execution and tactical follow-through to succeed.

> *By Birgitta Böckeler*
>
> Generative AI tools are increasingly integrated into software development, especially agentic tools that not only suggest code but act on it. While promising, these tools require experienced developers to supervise and guide them.
>
> Agentic tools often fail in three key ways:
>
> - **Time-to-commit missteps**: AI produces incorrect or non-compiling code, misdiagnoses issues, or hallucinates plausible but wrong solutions.
> - **Iteration-level disruptions**: The AI misinterprets requirements, implements features too broadly, or ignores team workflows, hindering collaboration.
> - **Long-term maintainability issues**: Generated code lacks reuse, introduces duplication, and accumulates technical debt due to poor architectural awareness.
>
> These tools lack contextual understanding—of architecture, naming, intent—which developers must still provide. Prompting helps, but it doesn't replace engineering judgment.
>
> Agentic AI isn't a replacement for developers but a tool that, like a junior teammate, needs oversight. Its value depends on the skill of the person wielding it.

> self-healing open source data connector 🍯
>
> superglue is a self-healing open source data connector. You can deploy it as a proxy between you and any complex / legacy APIs and always get the data that you want in the format you expect.
>
> Here's how it works: You define your desired data schema and provide basic instructions about an API endpoint (like "get all issues from jira"). Superglue then does the following:
>
> - Automatically generates the API configuration by analyzing API docs.
> - Handles pagination, authentication, and error retries.
> - Transforms response data into the exact schema you want using JSONata expressions.
> - Validates that all data coming through follows that schema, and fixes transformations when they break.

>
> Deep learning isn’t as unique or mysterious as it’s often made out to be. Many phenomena like overparametrization, double descent, and benign overfitting—features commonly associated with neural networks—can be replicated in simpler models and explained with long-standing frameworks like PAC-Bayes. Instead of restricting the hypothesis space to prevent overfitting, it’s more effective to allow flexibility with a soft preference for simpler, data-aligned solutions.
>
> Soft inductive biases are a powerful concept. They guide learning by favoring specific solutions without imposing strict limitations on the model’s expressiveness. For example, high-order polynomials with regularization or vision transformers' soft translation preferences outperform rigidly constrained models, bridging the gap between flexibility and precision. These biases drive better results across diverse data complexities and sizes.
>
> Generalization in deep learning can be understood with ideas like compressibility, which ties a model's performance to its ability to represent data simply. PAC-Bayes bounds reveal that even overparametrized models generalize effectively by balancing training accuracy with solution simplicity. Deep learning’s real distinction lies in its representation learning capabilities and phenomena like mode connectivity, making it versatile and universal in problem-solving.

> `cosine_similarity`, `vectors`, `typescript`, `ai`, `mathematics`

> Cosine similarity measures how similar two vectors are by examining the angle between them rather than their sizes. It focuses on direction, making it useful for comparing high-dimensional data like text embeddings. A score of 1 indicates vectors point in the same direction, 0 means they are perpendicular, and -1 shows they point in opposite directions. This technique is widely applied in AI for tasks like semantic search, recommendations, and content matching.

> A Bloom filter is a data structure that helps quickly determine if an element exists in a large dataset. It doesn’t store the actual data but instead uses a bit array and multiple hash functions to create a lightweight "fingerprint" for each item. This makes it both memory-efficient and fast, ideal for cases where speed and minimal storage are essential. However, it sacrifices perfect accuracy—while it can always confirm when an item isn’t in a dataset, it may produce false positives when indicating that an item is present.
