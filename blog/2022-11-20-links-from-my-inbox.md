  > Windows attempts to download a file from a dedicated Web server. Depending on which version of Windows, itâ€™s `http://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt` or `http://www.msftconnecttest.com/connecttest.txt`. If the download is successful and contains the correct contents, then Windows concludes that you have full Internet access.

- 2022-11-19 [Bannalia: trivial notes on themes diverse: Inside boost::unordered_flat_map](https://bannalia.blogspot.com/2022/11/inside-boostunorderedflatmap.html?m=1)
  > Starting in Boost 1.81 (December 2022), Boost.Unordered provides, in addition to its previous implementations of C++ unordered associative containers, the new containers boost::unordered_flat_map and boost::unordered_flat_set (for the sake of brevity, we will only refer to the former in the remaining of this article). If boost::unordered_map strictly adheres to the C++ specification for std::unordered_map, boost::unordered_flat_map deviates in a number of ways from the standard to offer dramatic performance improvements in exchange; in fact, boost::unordered_flat_map ranks amongst the fastest hash containers currently available to C++ users.

  >  If you run a server with more than a couple of hard drives, you're probably already familiar with S.M.A.R.T and the `smartd` daemon. If not, it's an incredible open source project described as the following:
  > smartd is a daemon that monitors the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) system built into many ATA, IDE and SCSI-3 hard drives. The purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability of the hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry out different types of drive self-tests.
