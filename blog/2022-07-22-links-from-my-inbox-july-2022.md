- 2022-07-22 [What I don’t like about working at a remote job](https://www.priconceptions.com/notebook/remote-jobs-bad)
> Working remotely permanently had been my wish ever since my managers started calling me back into the office. There was no possible way I would suffer through hours of commuting to feel awkward in an office again.
> However, with time came getting used to my situation. Even in the best possible world, your brain is always seeking something better. Although I really, really love remote work (please don’t take it away from me), I’ve noticed some things that make me sad about it.

## How the things work
- 2022-07-20 [What happens when you press a key in your terminal?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/07/20/pseudoterminals/)
> I’ve been confused about what’s going on with terminals for a long time.
> But this past week I was using xterm.js to display an interactive terminal in a browser and I finally thought to ask a pretty basic question: when you press a key on your keyboard in a terminal (like Delete, or Escape, or a), which bytes get sent?
> As usual we’ll answer that question by doing some experiments and seeing what happens :)
- 2022-07-20 [Beej's Guides](https://beej.us/guide/)
> These guides look nice and clean
- [Beej's Guide to C](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/) [WIP]\
> This is a rather comprehensive guide to C for folks who already know how to program in another language. The first half of the book is written in a tutorial style, while the second half is a reference section complete with examples (inspired by the incomparable *Turbo C Bible*). The goal is to keep this up-to-date with the latest C standards.

- 2022-07-10 [Fun and Games in Emacs - Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/fun-games-in-emacs)
> It’s yet another Monday and you’re hard at work on those TPS reports for your boss, Lumbergh. Why not play Emacs’s Zork-like text adventure game to take your mind off the tedium of work?
- `M-x hanoi-unix`
- `5x5`
- `M-x animate-birthday-present`
- `C-h f blackbox`
- `M-x bubbles-set-game-...`: (easy, medium, difficult, hard)

- `M-x dunnet` Emacs’s very own Zork-like text adventure game.
- `M-x gomoku`
- `M-x life`
- `M-x pong`
- `M-x snake`
- `M-x tetris`
- `M-x morse-region` and `M-x unmorse-region` -  translate a region into morse code
- `M-x dissociated-press` The Dissociated Press is a very simple command that applies something like a random walk markov-chain generator to a body of text in a buffer and generates nonsensical text from the source body.
- `M-x spook` - command inserts random words (usually into emails) designed to confuse/overload

## Security / Cryptography
### X.509
- 2022-07-03 [Understanding X.509 digital certificate thumbprints Morgan Simonsen's Blog](https://morgansimonsen.com/2013/04/16/understanding-x-509-digital-certificate-thumbprints/#comments)
> I got an interesting question about X.509 certificate thumbprints today from a colleague. Specifically, he wanted to know if you could renew a certificate and keep the thumbprint. The answer is no, unfortunately. So I thought I would explain why you can’t.
- 2022-07-03 [How Certificates Work: Public Key; Security Services Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc776447(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)
> Digital certificates are electronic credentials that are used to assert the online identities of individuals, computers, and other entities on a network. Digital certificates function similarly to identification cards such as passports and drivers licenses. They are issued by certification authorities (CAs) that must validate the identity of the certificate-holder both before the certificate is issued and when the certificate is used. Common uses include business scenarios requiring authentication, encryption, and digital signing.
- 2022-07-03 [Cryptography - Win32 apps Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptography-portal?redirectedfrom=MSDN)
> Microsoft cryptographic technologies include CryptoAPI, Cryptographic Service Providers (CSP), CryptoAPI Tools, CAPICOM, WinTrust, issuing and managing certificates, and developing customizable public key infrastructures. Certificate and smart card enrollment, certificate management, and custom module development are also described.
