    > WebGL runs on the GPU on your computer. As such you need to provide the code that runs on that GPU. You provide that code in the form of pairs of functions. Those 2 functions are called a vertex shader and a fragment shader and they are each written in a very strictly typed C/C++ like language called GLSL. (GL Shader Language). Paired together they are called a program.
