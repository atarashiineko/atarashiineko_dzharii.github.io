## Articles

- [Modern C++ for C Programmers: part 1 - Bert Hubert's writings](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/c++-1/) 

  > Welcome to part 1 of Modern C++ for C Programmers, please see the [introduction](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cpp-intro/) for the goals and context of this series.
  >
  > In this part we start with C++ features that you can use to spice up your code ’line by line’, without immediately having to use all 1400 pages of ‘The C++ Programming Language’.
  >
  > Various code samples discussed here can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahuPowerDNS/hello-cpp).

- 2022-03-05 [Beginner's Guide to Linkers](https://www.lurklurk.org/linkers/linkers.html)

  > This article is intended to help C & C++ programmers understand the essentials of what the linker does. I've explained this to a number of colleagues over the years, so I decided it was time to write it down so that it's more widely available.
