```
It's _MSC_VER. More info at MSDN and at predef.

But, be aware that some other compilers may also define it, e.g. Intel's C++ Compiler for Windows also defines _MSC_VER. If this is a concern, use #if _MSC_VER && !__INTEL_COMPILER.

A lot of the answers here are out of date/bad. So I'm going to attempt to answer it better. Granted I'm answering this question in 2020, so it's expected things would change.

* * * * *

**How do I run CMake for each target type (debug/release)?**

First off Debug/Release are called configurations in cmake (nitpick).

If you are using a single configuration generator (Ninja/Unix-Makefiles) you must specify the [CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html?highlight=cmake_build_type).

Like this:

```
# Configure the build
cmake -S . -B build/ -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Actually build the binaries
cmake --build build/

# Configure a release build
cmake -S . -B build/ -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build release binaries
cmake --build build/

```

For multi-configuration generators it's slightly different (Ninja Multi-Config, Visual Studio)

```
# Configure the build
cmake -S . -B build

# Build debug binaries
cmake --build build --config Debug

# Build release binaries
cmake --build build --config Release

```

If you are wondering why this is necessary it's because cmake isn't a build system. It's a meta-build system (IE a build system that build's build systems). This is basically the result of handling build systems that support multiple-configurations in 1 build. If you'd like a deeper understanding I'd suggest reading a bit about cmake in Craig Scott's book "Professional CMake: A Practical Guide

* * * * *

**How do I specify debug and release C/C++ flags using CMake?**

The modern practice is to use target's and properties.

Here is an example:

```
add_library(foobar)

# Add this compile definition for debug builds, this same logic works for
# target_compile_options, target_link_options, etc.
target_compile_definitions(foobar PRIVATE
    $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:
        FOOBAR_DEBUG=1
    >
)

```

NOTE: How I'm using generator expressions to specify the configuration! Using CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE will result in bad builds for any multi-configuration generator!

Further more sometimes you need to set things globally and not just for one target. Use add_compile_definitions, add_compile_options, etc. Those functions support generator expressions. Don't use old style cmake unless you have to (that path is a land of nightmares)

* * * * *

**How do I express that the main executable will be compiled with g++ and one nested library with gcc?**

Your last question really doesn't make sense.

```
With CMake, it's generally recommended to do an "out of source" build. Create your CMakeLists.txt in the root of your project. Then from the root of your project:

mkdir Release
cd Release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
And for Debug (again from the root of your project):

mkdir Debug
cd Debug
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
Release / Debug will add the appropriate flags for your compiler. There are also RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel build configurations.
```
