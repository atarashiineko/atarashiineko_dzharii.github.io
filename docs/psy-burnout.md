**Disclaimer:**

This page shares a variety of experiences, insights, and resources on burnout from people in the field, but it’s important to remember that these are shared perspectives, **not professional advice**. I strongly recommend that anyone dealing with burnout or mental health challenges reach out to a **well-being professional** or **therapist** for personalized support.

Burnout can feel overwhelming and, in my view, is rarely a result of personal failings. I **guestimate** that in 95% of cases, burnout occurs when we least expect it—often from factors outside of our control, like high-pressure environments, lack of support, or unclear boundaries. Many people experience burnout due to external pressures rather than personal weakness.

While I hope the information here provides some helpful perspectives, please don’t rely solely on what’s shared here to make decisions. Instead, consider this as one of many resources that might guide you toward understanding burnout better and taking action. By preparing ourselves with awareness and setting healthy boundaries, we can often be better prepared to manage burnout in the future.

[On Burnout, Mental Health, And Not Being Okay — Ludicity](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-burnout-mental-health-and-not-being-okay/) { ludic.mataroa.blog }

> In the blog post "On Burnout, Mental Health, And Not Being Okay," the author shares personal experiences with burnout and mental health challenges, emphasizing that it's normal to feel "Not Okay" at times. They recount three significant episodes:
>
> 1. **University Stress**: During their fourth year studying psychology, the author faced extreme sleep deprivation due to unpaid night shifts and thesis pressures, leading to severe mood swings and prolonged sadness.
> 2. **Professional Burnout**: In early 2019, while working in a demanding role, they experienced burnout characterized by emotional exhaustion and a sense of detachment from their work.
> 3. **Personal Struggles**: The author also discusses personal challenges, including feelings of inadequacy and the impact of societal expectations on mental health.

> The author, a remote junior Javascript developer, shares her struggles with remote work. Despite the appeal of flexibility, she faced challenges including the reality of spending all day at home, the loneliness that resulted from missing office interactions, and mental exhaustion from a lack of routine and breaks. The continuous focus on work led to near burnout, making her consider a hybrid work model that combines remote work with office days for better work-life balance and social interaction.

> 1. **Workplace Dysfunction**: Bureaucratic inefficiency, administrative bloat, and unnecessary meetings create a sense of sabotage in modern offices. **Solution**: Streamline decision-making and reduce bureaucratic roles.
> 2. **Employee Burnout**: Burnout is widespread due to overwork, isolation, and emotional stress. **Solution**: Acknowledge the signs of burnout, reduce workload, and foster open communication.
> 3. **Managerial Failures**: Many managers lack the skills to lead effectively, causing disengagement and poor team dynamics. **Solution**: Train managers in leadership and emotional intelligence.
> 4. **Corporate Culture**: Frequent reorganizations and unfair treatment create cynicism and stress among employees. **Solution**: Ensure fair policies and minimize unnecessary restructurings.
> 5. **Lack of Meaningful Work**: Employees feel disconnected from the social value of their work, seeing it as pointless. **Solution**: Align work tasks with human values and meaningful contributions.
>
> The most critical issues are **employee burnout** and the **disconnect between management and workers**, both of which contribute to widespread dissatisfaction and inefficiency in workplaces. Addressing these through better leadership training, reducing unnecessary work, and improving workplace communication can lead to healthier, more engaged employees.

2024-12-21 [Burnout ≠ Working Too Much – Terrible Software](https://terriblesoftware.org/2024/12/20/burnout-%e2%89%a0-working-too-much/) { terriblesoftware.org }

> If burnout was a natural byproduct of working too much (or too hard, or for too many hours), we’d see every founder/C-level suffering from it. And yet… they’re generally doing just fine; ICs and middle managers, on the other hand, are usually taking the biggest hit.
>
> Preventing burnout from happening on our teams means that first we need to identify the *real* causes of it, otherwise we’re just sending people to long vacations hoping the problem fixes itself. (It won’t.)
>
> Each case is different (of course), but from what I’ve seen with engineering teams over time, **burnout usually isn’t about work’s *volume* —it’s about a lack of purpose or agency**.
> ...
> 🟠 If you’re looking for something more practical, here’s what I usually do:
>
> - **Alignment, alignment, alignment:** Before kicking off any project, I share why I’m considering them for the job. I provide links to product specs, design docs, and user research so they understand the problem space. This simple step gives them agency and aligns their work with their interests and career goals.
> - **Clean-up period**: After wrapping up a project, we set aside two weeks for engineers to choose what they want to work on—refactoring messy code, experimenting with new technologies, improving internal tooling, or tackling long-ignored bugs. This autonomy gives them a sense of ownership and keeps intrinsic motivation high.
> - **Impact** **reminders**: Every now and then, I’ll show how the team’s work connects back to the company’s objectives. If you use OKRs (or any similar goal-setting framework), tie their efforts to those key outcomes. By repeatedly highlighting the real-world impact they’ve had—like improving user satisfaction scores, reducing operational costs, or enabling a new product launch—you reinforce the purpose behind their day-to-day tasks.



## Inside burnout: Rest and Relaxation

Prioritize adequate sleep and engage in restful activities to allow the body and mind to recuperate.  Incorporate simple mindfulness exercises, such as deep breathing or short meditation sessions, to reduce stress and enhance present-moment awareness. Or a good book, movie or even video game may distract you from burnout and help you rest. 



## Inside burnout: Social Connection

Reach out to trusted friends or family members for emotional support. Sharing your feelings and experiences can help alleviate feelings of isolation. However, not everyone has a trusted friend nearby. YouTube can sometimes serve as a surrogate for social connection—who knows, it might even be a better alternative at times. Please avoid any activities, including certain discussions, that could negatively impact your mood.

2024-01-27 [Long Term Refactors - Max Chernyak](https://max.engineer/long-term-refactors) 

> I have a theory that long refactors get a bad rap because most of them take far longer than we expect. The length leads to stress, an awkward codebase, a confused team, and often no end in sight. Instead, what if we *prepared* an intentional long term refactor? A few years ago, I began trying this method, and it has led to some surprisingly successful results:
>
> - We didn’t need to negotiate business timelines.
> - We didn’t need to compete against business priorities.
> - The team quickly understood and even took ownership of the refactor over time.
> - There was no increase in stress and risk of burnout.
> - PRs were easy to review, no huge diffs.
> - The refactor was consistently and collaboratively re-evaluated by the entire team.
> - We never wasted time refactoring code that didn’t need it.
> - Our feature development remained unblocked.
> - The team expanded their architectural knowledge.
> - The new engineers had a great source of first tasks.
> - We rolled out the refactor gradually, making it easier to QA, and reducing bugs.

>  Are you...
>  - Burned out by constant meetings?
>  - Distracted by the overwhelming load of Slack and email?
>  - Unable to maintain focus at work?
>  - Finding even the smallest of tasks both physically and mentally debilitating?
>  - Thinking about changing careers?
>
>  If you're feeling any of these things, you're not alone. Career burnout is happening to a lot of people.
>
>  For individual contributors
>  Take care of yourself and advocate for change:
>
>  - **Be unapologetically clear about your personal and professional boundaries.** This means [knowing your personality needs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/prescriptions-life/201902/why-lack-boundaries-can-lead-burnout) and sticking to them, just as much as it does setting aside time to focus on essential work. If your organization uses Slack, use the "Set status" functionality to communicate your availability.
>
>  - **Block times on your calendar when you are unavailable,** need to focus on deep work, or simply need a break. Lean into pushing back against unnecessary meetings.
>
>  - **Get off social media.** This is especially true for those working in digital marketing and social media. With political tensions high and bots promoting misinformation at increasing levels, Twitter can seem like an ["always on trauma machine."](https://digiday.com/media/social-media-managers-grapple-with-burnout/) Better to take a break.
>
>  - Go for a walk. Get exercise. **Just take a break.**
>
>  - **Evaluate your options.** Perhaps the burnout you are experiencing is a result of a toxic company culture, in which case your best bet might be to move on.



## After burnout: Physical Activity

Gradually introduce regular exercise, such as walking or yoga, to boost mood and energy levels.



## After burnout: Time Management

Develop organizational skills to balance work and personal life effectively, setting realistic goals and priorities.



## After burnout: Set Boundaries

Establish clear limits between professional and personal time to ensure adequate rest and leisure.

[psy-2022-07-28-BoundariesMeeting](https://blog.zharii.com/docs/psy-2022-07-28-BoundariesMeeting) { blog.zharii.com }

> Setting personal boundaries is essential for preventing burnout and fostering self-respect. This guide emphasizes the importance of boundaries to protect time, space, and mental bandwidth. Poor boundaries can lead to resentment, stress, and unintentional messages like undervaluing personal needs. Practical tips include defining work hours, reducing constant availability, and using tools like "Out of Office" settings. It's up to each individual to set, communicate, and model these boundaries clearly to ensure a balanced and sustainable approach to work and life.





## After burnout: Engage in Hobbies and Continuous Learning

Pursue enjoyable activities that provide fulfillment and a sense of accomplishment outside of work. Invest in personal and professional development to foster growth and adaptability, enhancing job satisfaction.

>  Exactly. I work on [my open source project](https://thomasmertes.github.io/Seed7Home) **to stay mentally healthy**.
> 
>  Programming **in companies** is what stresses us. There are countless issues:
> 
> - Managers who know everything better because they have programmed too (30 years ago for one week in BASIC under DOS).
> - Programs that tell you what you are allowed to check in (ExpensiveSourceCodeCheckProgram forbids checking in because of rule 12345).
> - Fellow developers who tell in a scrum meeting that the task has zero storypoints, because it could be done in 1 hour (they take 3 days but the managers just think they are fast and you are slow).
> - Project owners who start bargaining how many storypoints should be estimated for a story.
> - Unit tests, that check just mocks, to reach some level of code coverage.
> - The need to write more XML, Maven, Jenkins, etc. stuff than actual Java (or other language) code.
> - Bosses doing time estimates without asking you (I have already promised to the customer that this will be finished tomorrow).

>
> Almost three-quarters or, more precisely, **73% of developers have experienced burnout,** according to Jet Brains’ report, The State of Developer Ecosystem 2023. The report summarizes insights on developers’ preferred languages and technologies, methodologies, and lifestyles gathered from 26,348 developers from all around the globe.
>
> Another rather unexpected statistic involving three-quarters of developers answers the question of whether they have ever **quit a learning program or a course**. And **75% of respondents said they had.**
>
> The reason? Only a 📌**minority** of developers like learning new tools, technologies, and languages through courses. Instead, they prefer **documentation and APIs ( 67%)** or **blogs and forums (53%)**. When it comes to the type of content they prefer for learning, 53% prefer written content and 45% video. As expected, video content is preferred by respondents aged 21-19.
>
> When asked how much time they spend on learning weekly, 41% of developers said it’s 3 to 8 hours, and 30% of them said it’s one to two hours.
