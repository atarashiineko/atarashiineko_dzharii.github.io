And personal wiki



2022-01-26 [Zim - a desktop wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/)

> Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages. Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and images. Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a nonexistent page. All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. Various plugins provide additional functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor, a tray icon, and support for version control.

2022-01-18 ⭐  [About This Website · Gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/About) **Personal Wiki** 

> The content here varies from statistics to psychology to self-experiments/Quantified Self to philosophy to poetry to programming to anime to investigations of online drug markets or leaked movie scripts (or two topics at once: anime & statistics or anime & criticism or heck anime & statistics & criticism!).I believe that someone who has been well-educated will think of something worth writing at least once a week; to a surprising extent, this has been true. (I added ~130 documents to this repository over the first 3 years.)
