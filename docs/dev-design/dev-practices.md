# Dev Practices

- 2022-01-28 [Feature Flags](https://posthog.com/docs/user-guides/feature-flags) Feature Flags allow you to safely deploy and roll back new features. It means you can deploy features and then slowly roll them out to your users. If something has gone wrong, you can roll back new features without having to re-deploy your application. Feature Flags can also help you control access to certain features in your product (e.g. only show paid features to users with an active subscription).
