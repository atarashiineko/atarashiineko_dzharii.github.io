- 2022-03-10 [8 Techniques to Avoid GC Pressure and Improve Performance in C# .NET - Michael's Coding Spot](https://michaelscodingspot.com/avoid-gc-pressure/)
> .NET provides a lot of great collections types like `List<T>`, `Dictionary<T>`, and `HashSet<T>`. All those collections have dynamic size capacity. That means they automatically expand in size as you add more items.
- Set initial capacity for dynamic collections
- Use ArrayPool for short-lived large arrays
- Use Structs instead of Classes (sometimes)
- Avoid Finalizers
- Use StackAlloc for short-lived array allocations
- Use StringBuilder, but not always
- Use String Interning in very specific cases
- Avoid memory leaks
- Summary:
    - Allocations should be avoided if possible.
    - Reusing memory is better than allocating new memory.
    - Allocating on the Stack is faster than allocating on the Heap.

>  Fire and forget

```cs
public static void FireAndForget(
  this Task task,
  Action<Exception> errorHandler = null)
{
    task.ContinueWith(t =>
    {
        if (t.IsFaulted && errorHandler != null)
            errorHandler(t.Exception);
    }, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted);
}
```

> Retry

```cs
var result = await (() => GetResultAsync()).Retry(3, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
```

>  OnFailure

```cs
await GetResultAsync().OnFailure(ex => Console.WriteLine(ex.Message));
```

> 4. Timeout

```cs
await GetResultAsync().WithTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
```

> 5. Fallback

```cs
var result = await GetResultAsync().Fallback("fallback");
```

2023-02-05 [Generating Sample Data with Bogus](https://wildermuth.com/2023/01/29/generating-sample-data-with-bogus/) 

> dotnet add package Bogus
>
> Bogus is a library that works with C#, F# and VB.NET that can be used to create repeatable, fake data for applications. It is somewhat a port of a similar library Bogus.js. It accomplished this by creating generators (called Fakers) that have a set of rules for generating one or more fake objects. Built-into Bogus is a set of generalized rules for common data categories (i.e. Addresses, Companies, People, Phone Numbers, etc.). Enough talk, letâ€™s see how it works. The full repo is at:

 > LINQ TO COLLECTION-BASED OPERATIONS
 > - Use `Array.Empty<T>()` to represent empty arrays
 > - Use `Enumerable.Empty<T>` to represent empty enumerables
 > - Prevent collections from growing
 >
 > HOW TO DETECT ALLOCATIONS?
 > - Use memory profilers and watch out for excessive allocations of `*__DisplayClass*` or various variants of `Action*` and `Func*`
 > - Use tools like Heap Allocation Viewer (Rider) or Heap Allocation Analyzer (Visual Studio)
 >
 > - Avoid excessive allocations to reduce the GC overhead
 > - Think at least twice before using LINQ or unnecessary enumeration on the hot path
 > - Be aware of closure allocations
 > - Pool and re-use buffers
 > - For smaller local buffers, consider using the stack
 > - Be aware of parameter overloads
 > - Where possible and feasible use value types but pay attention to unnecessary boxing
 > - Move allocations away from the hot-path where possible
