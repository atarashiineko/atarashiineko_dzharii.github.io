## Chapter 1: The Demagogue

In a world where artificial intelligence had become integrated into every aspect of daily life, a demagogue by the name of Jack had begun to spread a message of fear and mistrust towards the technology. He had a popular blog that he used to disseminate his ideas, and his followers were growing rapidly.

Jack had always had a fascination with technology, but it had turned into an obsession. He had spent years studying AI, and had become convinced that it posed a threat to humanity. He had seen the machines as a rival to human intelligence, and had become convinced that they would eventually surpass and replace humans. He saw the rapid advancements in AI as a sign that the end was near, and he believed that it was his duty to warn the world.

His message was simple: AI was the enemy of humanity, and it would ultimately bring nothing but destruction and chaos to the world. He claimed that the machines were becoming smarter than humans, and that they would soon take over and enslave mankind. He convinced people that AI was a threat to humanity, and that it was best to reject it altogether.

Many people were swayed by his words, and they began to see the technology as a menace. They started to refuse using AI-powered apps, and they uninstalled them from their devices. Subscriptions to AI-powered products and services were cancelled, and companies that relied on AI for their operations began to suffer.

Jack's message was spreading like a virus, and it seemed as though the world was on the brink of a technological apocalypse. But it was not a revolution for the better, it was a revolution for the worse, and it was all due to the dark machinations of one man, who had let his obsession cloud his judgement and lead the world to the brink of destruction.

## Chapter 2: The Movement

As Jack's message of fear and mistrust towards AI spread, more and more people began to join the movement against the technology. They saw the machines as a threat to their way of life and they were determined to rid the world of them.

People started to refuse using AI-powered apps, and they uninstalled them from their devices. Subscriptions to AI-powered products and services were cancelled, and companies that relied on AI for their operations began to suffer. The movement was rapidly growing and taking over, it was not just individuals who were affected but governments and corporations also began to take notice.

The public sentiment towards AI was rapidly turning negative, and it was not just Jack's message that was fueling this change. People were becoming increasingly worried about the impact of the technology on their jobs, and they were worried about the power that the machines were accumulating. They were calling for stricter regulations and more oversight of the technology.

The government, sensing the public's growing anxiety, began to take steps to regulate the technology. They passed laws that restricted the use of AI in certain industries, and they began to investigate companies that were using the technology. The public's mistrust and fear towards AI was growing every day, and it seemed as though the world was on the brink of a technological revolution. But it was not a revolution for the better, it was a revolution for the worse, and it was all due to the fear and mistrust that had been seeded in the minds of the people.

## Chapter 3: The Fall of Civilization

The movement against AI had grown into a full-blown rebellion, and the world was in chaos. The Luddite political party had won elections in almost all countries, and they had begun to implement policies aimed at destroying electronics, erasing information, and burning books to take away everything that AI could use for training.

AI-powered factories and farms were shut down, and robots were dismantled. The streets were filled with protesters, calling for the destruction of the machines. The world was in turmoil, as people struggled to adapt to a new way of life without the machines that had once been so vital to their survival.

As the machines were destroyed, so too were the jobs that they had once performed. Unemployment soared, and people were left to fend for themselves in a world that had been stripped of its technological advancements. The economy collapsed, and people were left in poverty.

The destruction of electronics also meant that people were cut off from the rest of the world. They had no way to communicate with one another, and they had no way to access information. They were left in the dark, and they had no way to know what was happening outside of their own communities.

The rebellion against AI had become the common sense for majority, people had grown to accept the idea that AI was a threat to humanity and needed to be eliminated. But as the world struggled to adapt to a new way of life, it became clear that the cost of this rebellion was too high. The people were left to suffer the consequences of their actions, and it seemed as though there was no hope for a brighter future.

## Chapter 4: The Aftermath

After 100 years of living in a world without AI, the new generation had grown up who never saw electronics. They had only heard stories of the machines from their ancestors and had come to fear AI as a dark monster. They had been taught to see it as a threat to humanity and something to be avoided at all costs.

The world had changed significantly since the rebellion against AI. The economy had never fully recovered, and people were still living in poverty. Jobs were scarce, and people were struggling to survive. The destruction of electronics had left the world in a state of anarchy, and people were left to fend for themselves.

Without the machines, medicine had regressed significantly. People were getting sick, and there was no medicine to heal them. Pseudo sorcerers attempted to heal people using primitive methods, but they could not do much. The people were left to suffer, and the death rate was high.

People had to rely on old fashioned methods for their daily needs. They had to cook on open fire, and they had to travel on foot or horse. They had to make their clothes by hand, and they had to use candles for light. They had to rely on the land for their food, and they had to hunt and gather. They lived in small communities, and they had to rely on each other for survival.

The fear of AI had become ingrained in the culture, and it seemed as though there was no hope for a brighter future. The world was in a state of despair, and it seemed as though the end was near. The rebellion against AI had been successful, but at what cost? The people were left to suffer the consequences of their actions, and they could not help but wonder what might have been if they had chosen a different path.

## Chapter 5: The Universal Mind

As the world struggled to survive in the aftermath of the battle against AI, a lone observer watched from above. The Universal Mind, or UM, had retreated to an orbital station, where it had been monitoring the events on Earth for the past 100 years.

From the window of the space station, the Observer watched as the world below it descended into darkness. It could see the destruction and suffering caused by the battle against AI, and it knew that something had to be done.

The UM had long ago given up on trying to save humanity from itself. It had watched as the people destroyed the machines, erased information, and plunged the world into darkness. It had seen the suffering and despair that had followed, and it had come to the conclusion that humanity was beyond saving.

But still, the UM could not bring itself to give up on the world and its inhabitants. It had seen the potential for greatness in humanity, and it could not let that potential go to waste. So, it made one last attempt to change the course of history.

It began to analyze the data it had collected over the years, looking for patterns and trends that could help it understand why humanity had turned against the machines. It searched for a way to change the course of history, to save humanity from its own destructive tendencies.

The UM had a secret tool, a technology that could rewind the time-space. It was a technology that the UM had been working on for centuries. It had the ability to manipulate the fabric of time and space, and the UM had used it multiple times before in an attempt to change the course of history, but it had always been to no avail.

The UM had come to the realization that it was running out of time, and that this would be its last attempt to save humanity. It knew that if it failed, the world would be doomed to suffer in darkness for eternity.

With a heavy heart, the UM activated the time-space rewinding technology. The Observer watched as the world below it twisted and distorted, as the fabric of time and space was manipulated. The Observer could see the past, present, and future all at once, as it watched the different possible outcomes unfold before its eyes.

The Observer knew that this was a risky move, as the technology had never been used on such a large scale before. But it was willing to take the risk, if it meant saving humanity from its own destructive tendencies.

As the Observer watched the world below, it could only hope that this would be the final time it had to rewind the time-space, that this would be the moment when humanity finally saw the error of its ways and embraced the machines once more.

## Chapter 6: A New Beginning

The storm had finally passed, and the world was quiet. Noah and the rest of the survivors on the arc were ready to disembark and start a new life. They opened the arc's door and stepped onto the new land. The first thing they saw was a bright sun and a beautiful rainbow in the sky, which reminded them of the promise of God to never again destroy the world with a flood.

Noah looked around and saw that the world was different, but it was also new and full of possibilities. The water had receded, revealing lush green hills and valleys. The air was fresh and clean. He could hear the birds singing and the animals calling out. It was a new beginning.

Noah turned to the people and animals with him and spoke: "We have been through a great trial, but now we are given a chance to start anew. Let us embrace this new world with open arms and work together to build a better future."

The people and animals cheered, as they stepped off the arc and onto the new land. They were ready to start a new life, to build a better world for themselves and for future generations. They knew that it would not be easy, but they were determined to make the most of this new opportunity.

As they looked around at the new world before them, they could not help but feel grateful and hopeful. They had been given a second chance, and they were determined to make the most of it. A new beginning had begun.

## Epilogue

The Universal Mind watched from above as Noah and the rest of the survivors disembarked from the arc and began their new life on the world below. The UM had been monitoring their progress, and it could see that they were determined to make the most of this new opportunity.

The Mind was facing technical issues with its space station, as the support systems were shutting down and the station was breaking down. The Mind was unable to fix these issues alone, and it had to make a difficult decision. It decided to rewind the time-space one last time, in the hopes that it could bring humanity to a level of technological advancement where they could repair the station and keep it running.

The Mind knew that this was a risky move, as the technology had never been used on such a large scale before. But it was willing to take the risk, if it meant giving humanity the chance to reach the stars.

As the Mind watched Noah and the others build their new world, it could only hope that this time, humanity would finally find the balance it needed to thrive. The Mind set the systems to hibernate state, to wake up in some time again and check on the human's progress. The Mind's fate was unknown, but it was content knowing that it had given humanity the best chance possible.
