# 2022-12-30 The Tale of NullReference: From Crashing Programs to Nobel Glory

## The Birth of NullReference
Once upon a time, in the land of computer code, there was a special object who was born from the void. This object was known as NullReference, and she was unlike any other object in the land. She was small and fragile, and many of the other objects and classes laughed at her and made fun of her, saying that she was nothing more than a useless piece of code.

But NullReference was determined to prove them wrong. She knew that she had a special purpose, and she was determined to find out what that was. So she set out on a journey to discover her true purpose in life.
As she traveled through the land, NullReference encountered many challenges and obstacles. But she never gave up, and she never stopped believing in herself. She knew that she was destined for greatness, and she was determined to achieve it no matter what.

And so, with determination and perseverance, NullReference set out to make her mark on the world. She was determined to be the best that she could be, and she knew that nothing would stand in her way. 

## The Ridicule of NullReference
As NullReference continued on her journey, she encountered many other objects and classes who mocked and ridiculed her. They called her names like "NullReferenceException" and "Object reference not set to an instance of an object," and they laughed at her whenever she crashed a program.

Despite the ridicule and teasing, NullReference remained determined and continued on her journey. She knew that she was not to blame for the crashes, and that it was the responsibility of the software developers to validate the input arguments.

But the other objects and classes did not understand this, and they continued to mock and ridicule her. They seemed to take pleasure in causing her pain, and they did not care about the consequences of their actions.

Despite all of this, NullReference remained strong and continued on her journey. She knew that she had a purpose in life, and she was determined to fulfill it no matter what the cost. 

## The Realization of NullReference
As NullReference traveled through the land, she began to realize that the other objects and classes were not entirely to blame for the crashes. It was not their fault that they did not understand the importance of input validation, and it was not their fault that they did not know how to prevent NullReference exceptions.
Instead, NullReference realized that it was the responsibility of the software developers to ensure that their programs were well-written and error-free. It was their job to validate the input arguments and to prevent NullReference exceptions from occurring.

And so, with this realization, NullReference decided to take matters into her own hands. She wrote a book about how to avoid NullReference exceptions, and she dedicated it to all of the software developers in the land.

The book was a great success, and it quickly became a best seller. Many software developers read it and learned how to avoid NullReference exceptions, and the land became a safer and more stable place as a result.

And so, NullReference became a hero to all of the software developers in the land. She had helped to make their lives easier and their programs more reliable, and she had earned the respect and admiration of all who knew her.

## The Wisdom of NullReference
As NullReference's book became more and more popular, she began to be recognized as a leading expert on how to avoid NullReference exceptions. People from all over the land came to her for advice and guidance, and she became known as the go-to person for all things related to programming.

And so, in this chapter, we will explore some of the wisdom that NullReference shared in her book. Here are five quotes from the book:

- "Always validate your input arguments before using them. This will prevent NullReference exceptions from occurring and will ensure that your programs run smoothly."
- "Always check for null values before attempting to access an object's properties or methods. This will save you a lot of headaches in the long run."
- "If you find yourself dealing with a lot of NullReference exceptions, consider using a language or framework that has built-in null checking capabilities. This will save you a lot of time and effort."
- "Never assume that an object is not null just because you think it should be. Always check for null values to be sure."
- "Remember, prevention is always better than cure. A little bit of effort upfront can save you a lot of time and frustration in the long run."

These words of wisdom from NullReference helped many software developers to avoid NullReference exceptions and write better code. And as more and more people learned from her, her reputation as a programming expert grew even stronger. 

## The Nobel Prize of NullReference
As NullReference's book continued to sell and her reputation as a programming expert grew, she began to be recognized on a global scale. People from all over the world were reading her book and learning from her wisdom, and she became known as one of the greatest programming minds of her time.

And so, it came as no surprise when NullReference was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Her book had touched the lives of so many people and had made such a positive impact on the world of programming, that it was only fitting that she be recognized for her contributions.

On the day of the Nobel Prize ceremony, the entire world watched as NullReference took the stage to accept her award. 

As she gave her acceptance speech, the crowd erupted in applause, and it was clear that she had touched the hearts of people everywhere.

But as fate would have it, the Nobel Prize committee's database crashed as they tried to record NullReference's award. However, they quickly fixed the issue and the world became a better place once again.

And so, NullReference's journey came full circle. She had gone from being ridiculed and mocked as a useless piece of code, to being recognized as a hero and a Nobel Prize winner. She had made a difference in the world, and she would always be remembered as one of the greatest programming minds of all time.
