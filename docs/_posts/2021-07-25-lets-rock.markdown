Dear Diary,

I remember, 8 years ago, back in Ukraine I’ve used to run even several blogs.
Blogging were super useful, since I’ve been able to post my new findings or the results of my research and than find that note after some time. I’ve met a few like-minded friends because of my posts. This is a great tool. But then… I’ve stopped.

Because of my English isn’t perfect…
Because of lack of time, other things, video games…

Finally: the circle is now complete. I have not fixed all my issues before I have re-started the blogging, but, really, should I?

This is my official first post. I don’t know what I am going to do in the future, but I am gonna publish this right now.
