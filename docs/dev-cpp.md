## New Project Templates

2023-05-17 [cpp-best-practices/cmake_template](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cmake_template)

> "cmake_template" is a C++ Best Practices GitHub template designed for quick C++ project setups. Currently undergoing a major update, it enables Address Sanitizer, Undefined Behavior Sanitizer, treats warnings as errors, and performs static analysis using clang-tidy and cppcheck. It uses CPM for dependencies and provides a basic CLI example, testing examples, and a large Github action testing matrix. It requires cmake and a compiler to use. The project includes a simple usage example of FTXUI, featuring a game.

> This is a boiler plate for C++ projects. What you get:
>
> - Sources, headers and mains separated in distinct folders
> - Use of modern [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for much easier compiling
> - Setup for tests using [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)
> - Continuous testing with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), with support for C++17.
> - Code coverage reports, including automatic upload to [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) and/or [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io/)
> - Code documentation with [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)

- 2023-06-24 [Make your programs run faster by better using the data cache - Johnny's Software Lab](https://johnnysswlab.com/make-your-programs-run-faster-by-better-using-the-data-cache/)

  >  It covers the following topics and tips:
  >
  > - The concept and importance of **cache memory** and how it compensates for the difference in speed between processor and main memory.
  > - The principles of **temporal and spatial locality**, which govern the behavior of real-world programs and affect the cache performance.
  > - The tips and rules for **better exploiting the data cache** in different scenarios, such as:
  >   - Using **arrays** of classes or structs instead of values, to increase the cache utilization and reduce the cache misses.
  >   - Aligning the **starting address of the array** and the **class data** to the cache line size, to avoid splitting the data across multiple cache lines and to optimize the cache access.
  >   - Performing **loop interchange** on **matrices**, to move the loop over the innermost position and to eliminate column-wise accesses, which are costly for the cache.
  >   - Avoiding **padding** in **classes and structs**, to make sure they are correctly aligned and to reduce the cache overhead.
  >   - Sorting the **variables in the declaration** of the classes by size from largest to smallest, to guarantee that the compiler will not insert any padding and to optimize the cache access.
  > - The tools and references available to help with the data cache optimization, such as **pahole** and **StuctLayout**, which can help with exploring and visualizing the paddings in the classes.

```
It's _MSC_VER. More info at MSDN and at predef.

But, be aware that some other compilers may also define it, e.g. Intel's C++ Compiler for Windows also defines _MSC_VER. If this is a concern, use #if _MSC_VER && !__INTEL_COMPILER.

> Learning C was quite difficult for me. The basics of the language itself weren’t so bad, but “programming in C” requires a lot of other kinds of knowledge which aren’t as easy to pick up on:
>
> - C has no environment which smooths out platform or OS differences; you need to know about your platform too
> - there are many C compiler options and build tools, making even running a simple program involve lots of decisions
> - there are important concepts related to CPUs, OSes, compiled code in general
> - it’s used in such varied ways that there’s far less a centralised “community” or style than other languages

While running, the majority of what programs do is load values from memory, do some computation on them, and then store the result back in memory.

> In this post I'm going to introduce you to the basics of memory allocation. Allocators exist because it's not enough to have memory available, you need to use it effectively. We will visually explore how simple allocators work. We'll see some of the problems that they try to solve, and some of the techniques used to solve them. At the end of this post, you should know everything you need to know to write your own allocator.

> DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) is an open-source software project that provides a set of libraries and drivers for fast packet processing in user space. Its main goal is to increase the performance of packet processing applications running on standard computing platforms. The project is hosted and can be accessed at [www.dpdk.org](http://www.dpdk.org/). It's widely used in network interface cards, routers, firewalls, and other networking appliances.




### C language development

> Cello is a library that brings higher level programming to C.
> New C syntax for New Era!
```c
#include "Cello.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

  /* Stack objects are created using "$" */
  var i0 = $(Int, 5);
  var i1 = $(Int, 3);
  var i2 = $(Int, 4);

  /* Heap objects are created using "new" */
  var items = new(Array, Int, i0, i1, i2);

  /* Collections can be looped over */
  foreach (item in items) {
    print("Object %$ is of type %$\n",
      item, type_of(item));
  }

  /* Heap objects destructed via Garbage Collection */
  return 0;
}
```
- 2022-03-16 [libmill](http://libmill.org/index.html) Libmill is a library that introduces Go-style concurrency to C
```c
go(foo(arg1, arg2, arg3));
chan ch = chmake(int, 0);
chan ch = chmake(int, 1000);
chs(ch, int, 42);
```

> SIMD stands for "Single Instruction Multiple Data," and is one of [several approaches to parallelism](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/parallel/tax.aspx) found in modern high-performance computing.
>
> Vector instructions are a primary example of SIMD parallelism in modern CPUs. For instance, the vector add instruction is a single instruction (add) that acts on multiple data (vectors) to yield a vector of sums. Given the two vectors `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the vector result `(6, 8, 10, 12)` is produced in a single operation. This operation is illustrated in the diagram and linked video below.
