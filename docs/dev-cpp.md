```
It's _MSC_VER. More info at MSDN and at predef.

But, be aware that some other compilers may also define it, e.g. Intel's C++ Compiler for Windows also defines _MSC_VER. If this is a concern, use #if _MSC_VER && !__INTEL_COMPILER.

> Learning C was quite difficult for me. The basics of the language itself weren’t so bad, but “programming in C” requires a lot of other kinds of knowledge which aren’t as easy to pick up on:
>
> - C has no environment which smooths out platform or OS differences; you need to know about your platform too
> - there are many C compiler options and build tools, making even running a simple program involve lots of decisions
> - there are important concepts related to CPUs, OSes, compiled code in general
> - it’s used in such varied ways that there’s far less a centralised “community” or style than other languages
