> Data structures and algorithms interviews make some data engineers scream and others cry. Although there are a rare few who smile when barraged with a list of difficult questions pulled from Leetcode. In this newsletter, I’m not trying to turn you into a masochist who LOVES these types of interviews; I’m trying my best to minimize the fear and uncertainty

> ne section I added now was **Behavioral Questions**. These are questions of the form *“Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker. How did you resolve it?”*. Typically, you should answer them using the STAR framework: Situation, Task, Action, Result, Reflection. In the past, I have failed interviews because of these questions – I hadn’t prepared, and couldn’t come up with good examples on the spot in the interviews.
>
> This time I went through a good list of such questions ([Rock the Behavioral Interview](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leapai/)) from Leetcode, and thought about examples to use. Once I had good examples, I wrote the question and my answer down in the document. Before an interview, I would review what I had written down, so I would be able to come up with good examples. This worked well, I didn’t fail any interviews because of behavioral questions.
>
> In the document I also wrote down little snippets of code in both Python and Go. I tried to cover many common patterns and idioms. I did this so I could refresh my memory and quickly come up with the right syntax in a coding interview. I ran all the snippets first, to see that I hadn’t made any mistake, and included relevant output. Reviewing these snippets before an interview made me feel calmer and more prepared.

> I also watched a good video by Gergely Orosz, 🚩 [Confessions from a Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs), on technical interviews in general. Some takeaways: be curious and collaborative, and ask questions.
