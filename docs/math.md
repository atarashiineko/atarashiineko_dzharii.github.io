> The most important thing about reading this blog post is to not get scared off by the formulas. The post may look like all the crap you normally skim over, so you may be tempted to skim over this one. Donâ€™t! **None of this is hard.** Just read the post top to bottom, and I promise you every individual step and the whole thing put together will make sense.
