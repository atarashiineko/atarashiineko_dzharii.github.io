2023-04-24 [Opening up about my ADHD. Diagnosed at 34, I hope my story can… | by Kyle Gordon | Medium](https://medium.com/@kylegordon/opening-up-about-my-adhd-3dfe6e42bf7c)

> It would be a mistake to write a blog about ADHD without having a summary at the beginning. I know I would need one. So here it is :
>
> I’ve always had focus issues but I misdiagnosed them as problems related to energy. Through school and career I found that the only reliable way for me to motivate myself was to generate stress and consume an unhealthy amount of caffeine. At first doing work just before it’s due, and later in life harnessing it in a more healthy manner by faking early deadlines. Late 2021 I got sick and I couldn’t drink caffeine anymore and stress caused me a good deal of pain. Thought my career was over, so I turned to my doctor and she sent me to be evaluated for ADHD and Bipolar. Turns out I have ADHD and the medication has given me a new lease on life. Please, if you relate to my story at all, pursue help.

## Key Facts

ADHD, short for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, is a kind of brain disorder. Let's see who it affects:

- Around 11% of school-aged kids in the US and 7.2% worldwide.
- About 3.4% of adults.
- Interestingly, less than 75% of these cases keep showing symptoms into adulthood. More on this at  [chadd.org](https://chadd.org/understanding-adhd/)

But hey, these numbers are a bit confusing. Why? Because a bunch of ADHD cases never get spotted, which is a major issue. Here are a few interesting points:

- Len Adler, a big shot in ADHD research and a professor at New York University, thinks that at least 75% of adults with ADHD don't even know they have it.
- Adults with undiagnosed ADHD are more likely than others to have mood problems, feel really sad, and deal with anxiety.
- Edward Hallowell, a top ADHD expert (who also has ADHD), says adults with undiagnosed ADHD often struggle at work. They may get fired often, suddenly quit, or just not do as well as they could. This can lead to losing confidence, motivation, and happiness over time. They might just settle for less than what they could achieve if they were diagnosed and treated.

And here's a little extra: Women and people identified as female at birth who are neurodivergent are often missed when it comes to diagnosing ADHD. This is because doctors and mental health folks often overlook their symptoms. You can read more on this  [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6445815/).

ADHD symptoms come from difficulties with something called executive functioning skills. To get a better idea of what ADHD can look like in a person, take a peek at this  [comic by Dani Donovan](https://www.adhddd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AlsoADHD-1.png).

## How to Build an ADHD-Friendly Workplace

ADDitude magazine says that folks with ADHD need a few things to be at their best: incentives, positive vibes, and clear deadlines. Here are some tips they suggest:

- Expect tasks to take longer than you might think. And by longer, we mean *way* longer.
- Build in time for transitions during your day.
- Break big tasks into bite-sized pieces.
- Jot everything down. Yes, even those random thoughts that pop into your head.

- Perfection is a trap. Don't fall for it.
- Create a workspace that helps you focus, whatever that looks like for you.
- Have everything you need for work close at hand.
- Kick things off with the fun stuff. It'll help you get in the groove for the rest of your work.

- Make deadlines impossible to ignore.
- Try focusing on what you *want* to do instead of what you *don't* want to do. Your brain isn't great at understanding negatives.

Remember, these hacks work best when they fit you. So keep track of what works for you. A couple of good resources are The How Skills coaching and Jessica McCabe’s Motivation Bridge videos: [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM0Xv0eVGtY) & [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7eWb0nINPg)

And hey, don't forget that ADHD is a mixed bag. There's good stuff and tough stuff.

There are lots of great things about ADHD, like the creativity, empathy, grit, and talents it brings. People with ADHD have unique strengths that can turn ADHD into a plus, not a minus:

- **Problem Solving:** The way your thoughts bounce around can help you come up with solutions others might miss.
- **Imagination & Creativity:** People with ADHD don't just think outside the box. We build our own castles with our endless imagination.
- **Love for Life:** People with ADHD know how to find the silver lining and enjoy life, even when things are tough.
- **Acceptance:** Living with ADHD can make us more accepting of differences in ourselves and others.
- **Compassion:** Being different makes people with ADHD understand others who are different. We always root for the underdog.
- **Perseverance:** Kids and adults with ADHD often have to work twice as hard. But that struggle can build a strong will to keep trying until you succeed.
- **Observation Skills:** ADHD doesn't always mean you can't pay attention. Sometimes it means you notice *everything*, including things others overlook.
- **Laser-Focus:** When people with ADHD get in the zone, they can get a lot done really fast.

But, ADHD can also make things really hard. It's been linked to:

- Struggling at school or work
- Unemployment
- Drinking or using drugs too much
- Getting into car accidents or other accidents
- Rocky relationships
- Bad physical and mental health
- Low self-esteem
- Money problems
- Run-ins with the law
- Suicide attempts

**Other conditions** that can make ADHD even harder to deal with often show up too. These include:

- **Other mental health conditions:** Adults with ADHD are more likely to also have conditions like personality disorders, intermittent explosive disorder, and substance use disorders.
- **Learning disabilities:** Adults with ADHD might not do as well on academic tests as you'd expect for their age, intelligence, and education. These disabilities can include problems with understanding and communicating.

- **Mood disorders:** Many adults with ADHD also have depression, bipolar disorder, or another mood disorder. While these aren't caused by ADHD, the repeated disappointments and difficulties that come  with ADHD can make mood problems worse.
- **Anxiety disorders:** These are common in adults with ADHD. Anxiety can make you worry, feel nervous, and have other symptoms. The challenges and setbacks that ADHD brings can add to this anxiety.

You can read more about these challenges  [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350878).

So there you have it. ADHD can be tough, but it also comes with its own special strengths. And by creating a work environment that understands and supports people with ADHD, we can all do our best work together.

## Key Areas to Provide Support and Allyship

1. Recognize the impact of ableism and avoid positioning neurotypical individuals as the "norm". Jessica McCabe puts it well, describing ADHD as not a "failed version of normal".
2. Invest in learning how ADHD brains function – your presence here is an excellent start! Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of an ADHD brain can prevent misconceptions that mistakes are due to a lack of care or effort.
3. Embrace the differences in how brains operate and provide positive reinforcement for things ADHD brains excel at. For people with ADHD, positive reinforcement is a much stronger motivator than negative reinforcement or criticism, which can cause undue harm.
