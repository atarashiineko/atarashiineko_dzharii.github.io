> The `DNS` setting of a standard WireGuard config file can be used to specify the DNS resolvers to query when the WireGuard interface is up, as well as the domains to search for unqualified hostnames. On Linux, the [wg-quick](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg-quick.8) program expects to be able to use the traditional [resolvconf](https://gitlab.com/jdthood/resolvconf) utility for this; however, most modern Linux distributions use [systemd-resolved](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html) instead.
