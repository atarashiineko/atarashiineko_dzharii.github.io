### Why boundaries important:

- Boundaries are the path to self respect
- The most compassionate people are the most boundaried
- Prevents burnout and resentment

### Resentment is part of the Envy family of emotions.

- I'm not mad because you're resting, I'm mad because I'm so bone tired, and I want to rest. But, unlike you, I'm going to pretend that I don't need to.
- I'm not furious what you're okay with something that's really good and imperfect. I'm furious because I want to be okay with something that's really good and imperfect
- Your lack of work is not making me resentful; my lack of rest is making me resentful.
- We are resentful when we aren't getting our needs met, and it looks like others are.

### What messages do my lack of boundaries send?

#### Behavior: Sending or replying to an email at 11 pm.

The message I think I'm sending:
> I'm committed and on top of things.

The message I am actually reinforcing:

> My needs and my family aren't important. I'll be available all hours to succeed.

#### Behavior: Picking up the slack for someone else.

The message I think I'm sending:

> I'm a team player.

The message I am actually reinforcing:

> You don't have to be responsible for your work because I'll be responsible for you.

#### Behavior: Avoiding conflict to "keep the peace".
The message I think I'm sending:

> I care about the group.

The message I am actually reinforcing:

> My needs don't matter.
> You can push me around.
> Any conflict is bad.

### Protecting your Time and Space
- Work and non-work hours
- Response time to emails and chats
- Reasonable deadlines for tasks
- Workspace and non-workspace
- What you will outsource
- Radio silence plan for off hours and vacations
- Buffers between meetings or non-meeting days

### Protecting your mental and emotional bandwidth
- Increase clarity and communication (paint it done)
- What predictability do you need? What flexibility do you need?
- What behavior you will and won't tolerate from others.
- Transitions and recovery
- What mental load are you carrying?

### It's up to you
- It's up to you to set your boundaries
- It's up to you to uphold your boundaries
- Leverage resources and technology:
 - OOO settings
 - Disable notifications
 - Accountability partners

### When others don't respect your boundaries
- Calmly and clearly remind them of your boundary
- Stick to your boundary If you bend, you send the message your boundary (and you) don't matter
- What recourse do you have?

### Modeling for others
- Many people don't think others have successfully established boundaries (they don't know it's an option) Share how the conversation went
-  Simply and clearly share your boundaries
> I don't check my email between 5pm and 8pm. That's family time.
- Talk shift
> When do you need this by?
> - versus -
> I can get this to you next Tuesday. If you need it sooner, tell me which project I should put aside

### In summary
- Boundaries are hard. And they are the path to self-respect, compassion, balance, and high performance without burning out.
- Poor boundaries send unintended messages.
- Boundaries protect our time and space, our priorities, and our mental and emotional bandwidth
- It's up to you to set, communicate, model and protect your boundaries.
